## 🔧 Data Gathering Workflow

### Step 1: Research (15 minutes per trail)

**Official Sources (Always use these first):**
1. **National Park Service** - For Yosemite, Sequoia, Joshua Tree, Death Valley
   - URL: nps.gov/[park]/planyourvisit/hiking.htm
   - Provides: Distance, elevation gain, difficulty, trailhead location
   - **Example:** https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/halfdome.htm

2. **California State Parks** - For state park trails
   - URL: parks.ca.gov
   - Provides: Trail maps, parking info, fees

3. **USDA Forest Service** - For National Forest trails
   - URL: fs.usda.gov/main/angeles (or Cleveland, Eldorado, Shasta-Trinity, etc.)
   - Provides: Trail details, wilderness permits, conditions

4. **Bay Area Parks** - For SF Bay Area trails
   - URL: ebparks.org, openspace.org, parks.smcgov.org
   - Provides: Trail maps, parking, hours

**GPS & Elevation:**
- **Google Maps** - Get lat/lon coordinates (right-click → "What's here?")
- **CalTopo** (caltopo.com) - Topographic elevation data, GPX tracks
- **USGS TopoView** - Official USGS topo maps

**Photos:**
- **Unsplash.com** - Search "[trail name] california" or "[park name]"
- Free high-quality photos, already optimized
- Use query: `?auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=2000`

---

### Step 2: Create JSON File (20-30 minutes per trail)

**Naming Convention:**
```
[trail-name]-[region].json

Examples:
- half-dome-yosemite.json
- potato-chip-rock.json
- mission-peak.json
- mount-wilson-la.json
```

**Minimum Required Fields:**
- name, slug, state, state_slug, elevation, lat, lon
- mountain_hero (photo URL)
- tags (array)
- trails array with at least one trail object
  - name, difficulty, type
  - stats: distance, gain, time, difficulty
  - parking_info

**Nice-to-Have (add if time permits):**
- geo.markers (start/summit coordinates)
- geo.path (trail route coordinates)
- geo.chart (elevation profile)
- features array
- generated_description
- page_content (FAQs, seasonal guide, safety)
- seo (meta title/description)

---

### Step 3: Use AI to Speed Up (10 minutes per trail)

**ChatGPT/Claude Prompt:**
```
Create a JSON trail file for [Trail Name] in [Location], California.

Use this template: [paste template]

Research the trail using NPS/state park data and include:
- Accurate GPS coordinates from Google Maps
- Distance and elevation gain from official sources
- 3-5 FAQs about the trail
- Seasonal conditions
- Safety warnings
- Parking information

Format as valid JSON.
```

**Then manually:**
1. Verify coordinates are accurate
2. Check distance/elevation against NPS data
3. Add Unsplash photo URL
4. Review FAQs for accuracy
5. Save to `/home/user/hiking/website/src/data/california/`

---

### Step 4: Test on Site (5 minutes per trail)

```bash
# Start dev server
cd /home/user/hiking/website
npm run dev

# Visit: http://localhost:4321/california
# Check if trail appears

# Visit trail page: http://localhost:4321/california/hikes/[slug]
# Verify everything displays correctly
```

---

## ⚡ Speed Optimization Strategies

### Batch Processing (Recommended)

**Week 1: Yosemite (18 trails)**
- Research all 18 trails in one session (3 hours)
- Create JSON files using AI (3 hours)
- Manual review and corrections (2 hours)
- **Total: 8 hours for 18 trails**

**Week 2: San Diego (19 trails)**
- Same process
- **Total: 8 hours for 19 trails**

**Week 3: LA/Santa Monica Mountains (25 trails)**
- **Total: 10 hours for 25 trails**

**Week 4: Bay Area (19 trails)**
- **Total: 8 hours for 19 trails**

**Month 1 Total: 81 trails in ~34 hours**

### Hire Help (Fastest Option)

**Freelance Trail Researchers on Upwork/Fiverr:**

**Job Posting:**
```
Title: California Hiking Trail Data Entry ($5/trail)

Description:
Need someone to create JSON files for 100 California hiking trails.

Requirements:
- Research trail data from NPS/state park websites
- Fill out provided JSON template
- Find GPS coordinates using Google Maps
- Write 3-5 FAQs per trail
- Include parking and safety information

Pay: $5 per trail ($500 for 100 trails)
Timeline: 2-3 weeks

Skills needed: Research, data entry, hiking knowledge helpful
```

**Expected output:** 100 trails in 2-3 weeks for $500

---

### AI-Assisted Bulk Creation (Advanced)

**Create automation script:**

```javascript
// bulk-trail-creator.js
const trails = [
  {name: 'Clouds Rest', park: 'Yosemite', lat: 37.764, lon: -119.487, ...},
  // ... 100 more trails
];

for (const trail of trails) {
  // Use AI API to generate full JSON
  const json = await generateTrailJSON(trail);

  // Save to file
  fs.writeFileSync(
    `data/california/${trail.slug}.json`,
    JSON.stringify(json, null, 2)
  );
}
```

**Cost:** ~$20-30 in AI API calls for 100 trails
**Time:** 2-3 hours to set up, 1 hour to run and review

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with highest-traffic trails first**
   - Half Dome, Potato Chip Rock, Runyon Canyon = huge search volume
   - These drive traffic immediately

2. **Batch similar trails together**
   - All Yosemite in one session
   - Reuse descriptions/FAQs with modifications

3. **Don't perfect every detail initially**
   - Get 100 trails at 80% quality
   - Then go back and enhance top 20 trails to 100%

4. **User submissions**
   - Add "Submit a Trail" form to website
   - Let hikers contribute data (with your review)

5. **Reuse content intelligently**
   - "Best time to visit Yosemite" applies to all Yosemite trails
   - "San Diego hiking tips" applies to all SD trails

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **This Week:** Add 15 more Yosemite trails (use NPS data)
2. **Next Week:** Add 20 San Diego trails
3. **Week 3:** Add 20 LA/Santa Monica trails
4. **Week 4:** Add 20 Bay Area trails

**Result after Month 1:**
- 80+ California trails
- 10x traffic increase
- Ready to tackle Colorado next
