## 🔥 DO THIS WEEK (Critical):

```bash
# Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
# Add property: summitseeker.io
# Verify ownership (DNS or HTML file)
# Submit sitemap: https://summitseeker.io/sitemap.xml
```

**Why:** Without GSC, Google may not even know your site exists!

### 2. Set Up Google Analytics 4 (30 minutes)
```bash
# Go to: https://analytics.google.com
# Create new property
# Add tracking code to website
# Set up goals: affiliate clicks, email signups

### 3. Add Alt Text to All Images (2 hours)
**Current:** Most images missing alt text
**Fix:** Add descriptive alt text using this formula:

❌ Bad: alt="mountain"
✅ Good: alt="Mount Washington summit view from Tuckerman Ravine Trail in winter"
```

**Template:**
```
alt="[Mountain Name] [view type] from [trail name] showing [key features]"
```

**Examples:**
- `alt="Franconia Ridge Loop trail marker at summit of Mount Lafayette in New Hampshire White Mountains"`
- `alt="Cadillac Mountain sunrise view over Atlantic Ocean in Acadia National Park Maine"`
- `alt="Mount Mansfield Sunset Ridge Trail rocky scramble section in Vermont Green Mountains"`

### 4. Compress All Images (1 hour)
```bash
# Use TinyPNG, ImageOptim, or Squoosh
# Target: <200KB for hero images, <100KB for thumbnails
# Keep aspect ratio, quality at 85%
```

**Before/After Example:**
- Original: 2.5MB → Optimized: 180KB (92% reduction!)

5. **Skip Analytics** - "If you can't measure it, you can't improve it"
6. **Buy Links** - Google will penalize you
7. **Neglect Speed** - 3+ second load time = higher bounce rate
8. **Ignore UX** - Good SEO means good user experience

### ✅ Do:
1. **Focus on User Intent** - Answer the question they're really asking
2. **Update Content Regularly** - Fresh content signals quality
3. **Internal Linking** - Link related trails together
4. **Build Relationships** - Outreach is about partnerships, not begging
5. **Be Patient** - SEO takes 3-6 months to show results
6. **Double Down on What Works** - If waterfall posts rank, make more
7. **Engage Your Community** - Reply to every comment/email
