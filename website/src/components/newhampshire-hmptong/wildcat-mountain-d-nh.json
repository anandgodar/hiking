      "description": "For an easier ascent of a 4000-footer, many hike up the Wildcat Ski Area\u2019s service road/trail (Polecat). It\u2019s a steady, non-technical climb on open ski slopes that leads right to the summit observation deck on Wildcat D. This route is relatively safe and straightforward, offering constant views across to Mount Washington and Tuckerman Ravine as you ascend. It\u2019s a great family friendly option to bag a high peak without the scrambles of the hiking trail.",
