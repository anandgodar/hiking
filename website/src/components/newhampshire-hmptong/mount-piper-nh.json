The top features a rock fire ring and expansive views over Lake Winnipesaukee and the Belknap Range. It\u2019s a wonderful spot for a picnic or sunset. The gentle grade and short distance make this a popular hike for families and those seeking a quick payoff. Many loop this with Whiteface or other nearby peaks for a longer outing.",
