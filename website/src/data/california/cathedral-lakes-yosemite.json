  "generated_description": "<p>Cathedral Lakes are two stunning alpine lakes nestled beneath the soaring Cathedral Peak in Yosemite's High Sierra. This moderate 8-mile round trip from Tuolumne Meadows is one of the park's most beautiful and accessible high-country hikes.</p><p>The lower lake features dramatic Cathedral Peak reflections, while the upper lake offers more solitude with equally spectacular granite spire views. Both lakes are popular backpacking destinations with designated campsites (wilderness permit required for overnight stays).</p>",

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which Cathedral Lake is better?",
        "answer": "Lower Cathedral Lake (3.7 miles) is larger with the iconic Cathedral Peak reflection view—it's the classic photo spot. Upper Cathedral Lake (4 miles) is smaller, quieter, and equally beautiful with more intimate surroundings. Most day hikers visit lower lake; backpackers often camp at upper lake for solitude."
      },
      {
        "question": "When does Tioga Road open?",
        "answer": "Tioga Road typically opens late May to early June depending on snow and closes in October/November. Cathedral Lakes Trail is accessible only when Tioga Road is open. Check Yosemite's road status before planning your visit—this is crucial for summer High Sierra trips."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a permit for Cathedral Lakes?",
        "answer": "No permit for day hiking! Only wilderness permits are required for overnight backpacking. Day hikers just need park admission ($35 vehicle fee). This makes Cathedral Lakes one of the most accessible High Sierra alpine lake experiences."
