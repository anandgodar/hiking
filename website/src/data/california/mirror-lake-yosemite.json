        "question": "When is Mirror Lake actually a lake?",
        "answer": "Mirror Lake has water April-June during snowmelt. By mid-summer (July-August), it's usually just a meadow with Tenaya Creek flowing through. The 'lake' is really a wide, calm section of the creek that creates perfect reflections in spring. For the iconic Mirror Lake reflection photos, visit May-early June."

      {
        "question": "Can I bike to Mirror Lake?",
        "answer": "Yes! The paved path to Mirror Lake is bike-friendly and very popular with cyclists. You can rent bikes in Yosemite Valley and ride to the lake, making this an easy family outing. The full loop around the lake is also bikeable."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Mirror Lake good for kids?",
        "answer": "Excellent for kids! The trail is mostly flat, paved at first, well-shaded, and follows a creek. Kids love playing by the water, skipping rocks, and looking for reflections. The easy terrain makes it doable even for young children (ages 4+) who can walk a few miles."
