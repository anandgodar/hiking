  "generated_description": "<p>The Mist Trail to Vernal Fall is one of Yosemite's most popular hikes, offering spectacular waterfall views with moderate effort. This 5.4-mile round trip showcases the power and beauty of the 317-foot Vernal Fall, especially during spring runoff when the falls roar with snowmelt.</p><p>The trail earns its name from the mist generated by the waterfall, which soaks hikers on the famous granite staircase section. Over 600 granite steps lead to the top of the falls, providing constantly changing perspectives of the cascade. In spring and early summer, expect to get wet\u2014raincoats recommended!</p><p>This trail serves as the first section of the longer Half Dome and Nevada Fall routes, making it an excellent introduction to Yosemite's high country hiking.</p>",

        "answer": "No permit required! The Mist Trail to Vernal Fall is accessible to all Yosemite visitors with park admission ($35 per vehicle). Only the Half Dome extension requires a permit."
      },
      {
        "question": "When is the best time to hike the Mist Trail?",
        "answer": "April through June offers peak waterfall flow with maximum mist and power. July-September has less water but better weather and drier trails. The trail can be icy and dangerous in winter/early spring."
      },
      {
        "question": "How wet will I get on the Mist Trail?",
        "answer": "In spring (April-June), you'll get soaked on the granite staircase section. Bring a rain jacket or poncho. By late summer (August-September), there's minimal mist. The trail is less slippery when drier but also less dramatic."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the Mist Trail difficult?",
        "answer": "It's moderate difficulty with 1,000 feet of elevation gain over 2.7 miles. The granite staircase (600+ steps) is the most challenging section. Good fitness helps, but it's doable for most hikers. Not recommended for those with knee problems."

      {
        "question": "Can I swim at the top of Vernal Fall?",
        "answer": "ABSOLUTELY NOT. The Emerald Pool above Vernal Fall has strong currents and people have been swept over the falls and died. Swimming is prohibited and extremely dangerous. Enjoy views from designated overlooks only."
