  "generated_description": "<p>Mount Whitney is the highest peak in the contiguous United States at 14,505 feet, making it a bucket-list summit for hikers nationwide. The 22-mile round trip from Whitney Portal gains over 6,100 feet of elevation, passing through multiple life zones from pine forest to alpine tundra.</p><p>The Mount Whitney Trail is one of America's most famous hiking routes, featuring 97 switchbacks, stunning High Sierra scenery, and the satisfaction of standing atop the Lower 48's highest point. On clear days, summiteers enjoy views spanning from the Owens Valley floor 10,000 feet below to the Sierra Nevada crest extending for hundreds of miles.</p><p><strong>Permits are extremely competitive:</strong> Apply via recreation.gov lottery (February) for May-October dates. Day hike and overnight permits are separate lotteries. Success rates are typically 10-20% in the main lottery.</p>",

      {
        "question": "Do I need a permit for Mount Whitney?",
        "answer": "Yes, permits are required year-round. May 1-Nov 1: lottery permits via recreation.gov (apply in February). Extremely competitive—10-20% success rate. Nov 2-April 30: Self-issue permits at Eastern Sierra InterAgency Visitor Center, first-come first-served. Day hiking and overnight permits are separate lotteries."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I hike Mount Whitney in one day?",
        "answer": "Yes, but it's extremely challenging. The 22-mile round trip with 6,100 ft gain typically takes 12-18 hours. Most day hikers start between midnight-3am to summit by noon and avoid afternoon thunderstorms. Requires excellent fitness and altitude acclimatization. Many prefer to split over 2-3 days backpacking."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the success rate for summiting Mount Whitney?",
        "answer": "Approximately 60-70% of permit holders successfully summit. Main reasons for turning back: altitude sickness, weather, insufficient fitness, or starting too late. Acclimatizing in the Eastern Sierra for 2-3 days before your hike dramatically improves success rates."
      },
      {
        "question": "When is the best time to hike Mount Whitney?",
        "answer": "July-September offers the best weather and snow-free conditions. July: longest days, possible snow patches. August: most stable weather, most crowded. September: fewer crowds, cooler temps, fall colors. June has significant snow requiring ice axe/crampons. October is possible but unpredictable weather and cold."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I prevent altitude sickness on Mount Whitney?",
        "answer": "1) Spend 2-3 days at 8,000-10,000 ft before attempting (camp at Whitney Portal or hike nearby peaks), 2) Ascend slowly—consider camping at Trail Camp (12,000 ft) the night before summit, 3) Stay hydrated (4+ liters/day), 4) Consider Diamox (prescription), 5) Turn back if symptoms worsen. Don't underestimate altitude."
