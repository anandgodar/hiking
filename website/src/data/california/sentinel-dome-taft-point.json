        "question": "Which is better for sunset: Sentinel Dome or Taft Point?",
        "answer": "Sentinel Dome is THE best sunset spot in Yosemite! 360-degree views mean you see sunset colors in all directions, including Half Dome glowing orange. Taft Point faces east so you see shadow progression rather than direct sunset. Many photographers hike to Sentinel Dome specifically for sunset."

      {
        "question": "Is Taft Point dangerous?",
        "answer": "Taft Point has NO railings at the cliff edge, which drops 3,000 feet straight down. It's safe if you're careful and stay back from the edge. Not recommended for young children or those with fear of heights. The Fissures (narrow cracks in the rock) are particularly exposed."

        "answer": "Typically late May/early June through October/November, weather dependent. Check Yosemite road conditions before visiting. When closed, these trails are inaccessible except by skiing/snowshoeing from Badger Pass (16+ miles round trip)."
