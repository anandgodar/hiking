This beautiful alpine lake sits beneath the towering face of Mount Hoffmann (10,850 ft) at 9,329 feet elevation, offering stunning High Country scenery without the typical multi-day backpacking commitment.</p><p>The lake features one of Yosemite's six High Sierra Camps, where reservations (lottery-based) provide tent cabins, breakfast, and dinner—making this a popular first High Sierra backpacking experience. Day hikers can picnic by the lake, enjoy the mountain reflections, and even continue to Mount Hoffmann summit for those seeking more adventure.</p>",

Day hikers are welcome to visit the area, but camp dining is for overnight guests only. It's a popular destination that adds interesting cultural elements to the hike."

        "question": "Can I swim in May Lake?",
        "answer": "Swimming is allowed but the water is COLD (even in summer, maybe 50-60°F). It's shallow near shore. Many people wade in on hot days but few actually swim. Better for quick dips than laps. The scenery makes up for the chilly water!"

Hoffmann offers 360-degree views of Yosemite's High Sierra and is worth the effort if you have energy."
