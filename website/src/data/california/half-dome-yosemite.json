  "generated_description": "<p>Half Dome is Yosemite National Park's most iconic summit and one of the most recognizable granite formations in the world. Rising 4,737 feet above Yosemite Valley, this massive granite dome offers unparalleled 360-degree views of Yosemite's High Sierra landscape.</p><p>The 14.2-mile round-trip hike is extremely strenuous, gaining 4,800 feet of elevation. The route passes two magnificent waterfalls—Vernal Fall and Nevada Fall—before the final ascent up the famous cable route. The cables, installed each spring and removed in fall, allow hikers to climb the final 400 feet of slick granite to the summit.</p><p><strong>Permit Required:</strong> Due to overwhelming popularity, Half Dome requires a permit year-round. Permits are distributed via lottery (apply at recreation.gov) and are extremely competitive during summer months.</p>",

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Do I need a permit to hike Half Dome?",
        "answer": "Yes, Half Dome requires a permit year-round. Day hikers need a Half Dome permit obtained through the recreation.gov lottery system. The preseason lottery (March) awards about 225 permits per day for May-September. A daily lottery awards remaining permits 2 days in advance. Permits cost $10 application + $10 per person if awarded."
      },
      {
        "question": "When are the Half Dome cables up?",
        "answer": "The cables are typically installed in late May (Memorial Day weekend) and removed in early October (after Columbus Day), weather permitting. Climbing Half Dome without cables requires technical climbing skills and equipment. Check Yosemite's website for current cable status."
      },
      {
        "question": "How difficult is Half Dome?",
        "answer": "Half Dome is extremely strenuous. The 14.2-mile hike with 4,800 feet of elevation gain typically takes 10-14 hours. The cable section is physically and mentally demanding, requiring upper body strength and comfort with heights. Not recommended for beginners or those with fear of heights."
      },
      {
        "question": "What time should I start hiking Half Dome?",
        "answer": "Start between 5:00-7:00am to avoid afternoon thunderstorms and heat. Most hikers take 6-8 hours to reach the summit and 4-6 hours to descend. Being on the summit during a thunderstorm is extremely dangerous."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I hike Half Dome in one day?",
        "answer": "Yes, Half Dome is typically done as a challenging day hike. Strong hikers complete it in 10-12 hours. Some prefer to backpack and camp in Little Yosemite Valley (requires wilderness permit) to split the hike over 2 days and avoid the pre-dawn start."
