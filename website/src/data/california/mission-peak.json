  "generated_description": "<p>Mission Peak is the Bay Area's most popular training hike, offering stunning 360-degree views from San Francisco to San Jose from its 2,517-foot summit. The distinctive pole at the summit (installed in 2010) has become an iconic photo opportunity, with hikers often waiting in line to pose with the landmark.</p><p>The 6.2-mile round trip via Hidden Valley Trail climbs steadily through open grassland, providing increasingly panoramic views of the South Bay, Fremont, and on clear days, the San Francisco skyline. Early morning hikers are often rewarded with spectacular sunrises and an inversion layer of fog filling the valleys below.</p><p>This trail is beloved by locals for fitness training, with many hiking it multiple times weekly. Expect to share the trail with serious trail runners, casual hikers, and first-time adventurers alike.</p>",

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What time should I start hiking Mission Peak?",
        "answer": "For parking and cooler temps: start before 7am on weekends, before 8am on weekdays. Sunrise hikers (starting 5-6am) get the best experience—cooler temps, amazing sunrise, and parking availability. Avoid midday in summer (too hot, no parking)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Mission Peak hard?",
        "answer": "It's moderate difficulty with sustained climbing. The 2,100-foot elevation gain over 3.1 miles makes it challenging for beginners. The trail is well-maintained and straightforward, but the steep grade and minimal shade can be tough. Good for fitness building."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I bring my dog to Mission Peak?",
        "answer": "Yes! Dogs are allowed on-leash. However, be aware: 1) Cows are present March-October, 2) Trail is steep and rocky in sections, 3) Very hot in summer (dangerous for dogs), 4) Bring water for your dog. Many locals hike with dogs successfully."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there really cows on Mission Peak?",
        "answer": "Yes! Cattle graze on Mission Peak March-October as part of vegetation management. They're generally docile but give them space. Keep dogs leashed and controlled. Don't approach or feed cows. Watch for cow pies on the trail."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the best season for Mission Peak?",
