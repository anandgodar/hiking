    "introduction": "<p>Forget the rocky beaches and gentle coves you might associate with Maine's coast. The Bold Coast is something else entirely—sheer cliffs plunging 100 feet to the crashing Atlantic, cobblestone beaches accessible only by steep trails, and a sense of wildness that's rare anywhere on the eastern seaboard.</p><p>Located in the Cutler Coast Public Reserved Land on Maine's Downeast coast, this trail system offers serious coastal hiking through a landscape that feels more like Scotland or Ireland than typical New England. It's remote, rugged, and rewards those willing to make the journey.</p>",

You'll encounter multiple viewpoints where 100-foot cliffs drop directly to the sea, plus access points to cobblestone pocket beaches.</p><h3>Extended Black Point Loop</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 9.8 miles loop</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,200 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate-Strenuous</li></ul><p>For more adventure, continue to Black Point, one of Maine's most dramatic coastal promontories. This adds significant distance but delivers even more spectacular cliff scenery. Allow 5-7 hours for the full loop.</p><h3>Beach Access Routes</h3><p>Several spurs lead down to the water—Long Point Cove, Fairy Head, and other spots where you can descend to dramatic cobblestone beaches. These add elevation loss and gain but are worth the effort on a nice day.</p>"

        "content": "<p>The Bold Coast offers experiences you won't find elsewhere in Maine:</p><ul><li><strong>True cliffs:</strong> Not gradually sloping rocks, but vertical drops of 60-100 feet directly into the ocean</li><li><strong>Remote coastline:</strong> Miles from roads or development—this is wilderness coast</li><li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Seabirds, seals, and occasionally whales visible from clifftop viewpoints</li><li><strong>Geology:</strong> Volcanic rock formations distinct from Acadia's granite</li><li><strong>Solitude:</strong> Even in summer, you might see only a handful of other hikers</li></ul><p>The \"Bold Coast\" name comes from early mariners who described these dramatic headlands. Standing at the cliff edge with waves crashing below, you'll understand why.</p>"

It's a long drive from anywhere—roughly 4.5 hours from Portland, 2.5 hours from Bangor. This remoteness is part of the appeal.</p><h3>Facilities</h3><p>The trailhead has a parking area and pit toilets. That's it. There are no services, water, or cell signal. Come prepared.</p><h3>Best Times</h3><ul><li><strong>June-September:</strong> Best weather; wildflowers in early summer</li><li><strong>Fall:</strong> Fewer bugs, clearer skies, migration season for seabirds</li><li><strong>Winter:</strong> Trails open but conditions can be harsh; dramatic storm watching</li></ul><h3>Weather Considerations</h3><p>The Bold Coast creates its own weather. Fog is common even when inland areas are sunny. Winds can be fierce. Bring layers regardless of the forecast.</p>"

Just be prepared for the elements.</p>"

There are no guardrails.</li><li><strong>Watch the tide:</strong> If you descend to beaches, know when the tide is coming in. Some coves can be cut off.</li><li><strong>No cell service:</strong> You're on your own out here. Tell someone your plans.</li><li><strong>Weather changes:</strong> Fog can roll in quickly. Know the trail well enough to navigate in limited visibility.</li></ul>"

    "conclusion": "<h2>Quick Reference</h2><table><tr><th>Route</th><th>Distance</th><th>Time</th><th>Features</th></tr><tr><td>Coastal Loop</td><td>5.8 mi</td><td>3-4 hours</td><td>Cliffs, views</td></tr><tr><td>Black Point Loop</td><td>9.8 mi</td><td>5-7 hours</td><td>Extended coast</td></tr></table><p>The Bold Coast is Maine's most dramatic coastal landscape—a place where the continent seems to end at sheer cliffs dropping to the sea. It's remote, challenging to reach, and completely worth the effort. For hikers seeking something wilder than Acadia's popular trails, this is the answer.</p>",
