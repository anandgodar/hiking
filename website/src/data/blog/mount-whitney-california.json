    "introduction": "<p>Mount Whitney stands at 14,505 feet—the highest point in the contiguous United States. Located in California's Sierra Nevada, it draws thousands of hikers each year seeking to stand on the Lower 48's rooftop. The remarkable thing about Whitney is that despite its height and prestige, the standard route is a trail, not a technical climb. With proper preparation, most fit hikers can reach the summit.</p><p>That said, Whitney is no casual endeavor. The 22-mile round trip with 6,100 feet of elevation gain, combined with altitude challenges, makes this one of America's most demanding day hikes. Most hikers split it into two days with a high camp.</p>",

From Trail Camp, the trail ascends 97 switchbacks to Trail Crest (13,600 ft) before traversing to the summit.</p><p>The final two miles are above 14,000 feet, where every step feels harder than it should. The summit itself is a flat plateau with a stone shelter built in 1909.</p>"

    "conclusion": "<h2>Quick Reference</h2><table><tr><th>Detail</th><th>Information</th></tr><tr><td>Summit Elevation</td><td>14,505 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Distance</td><td>22 miles RT</td></tr><tr><td>Elevation Gain</td><td>6,100 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Permit Required</td><td>Yes (lottery)</td></tr><tr><td>Best Season</td><td>July-September</td></tr></table><p>Mount Whitney is America's iconic summit—the highest point you can stand in the Lower 48 states. The permit lottery is frustrating, the altitude is challenging, and the distance is humbling. But standing on that summit, looking across the Sierra Nevada to distant horizons, you'll understand why thousands attempt it each year. It's a bucket-list hike that lives up to the hype.</p>",
