The AMC hut is a great rest stop (dogs stay outside).</p><p><strong>2. Lincoln Woods Trail</strong> - A flat, wide former railroad bed following the Pemigewasset River. Go as far as you like—dogs love the river access. Great for older dogs or puppies building stamina.</p><p><strong>3. Greeley Ponds</strong> - An easy 4.4-mile out-and-back to two scenic ponds. Gentle terrain and water for swimming make this a dog favorite.</p><p><strong>4. Diana's Baths</strong> - Short 1.2-mile walk to a series of cascading waterfalls with swimming holes. Very popular, so go early with your pup.</p>"

Mount Carrigain</strong> - A 10-mile round trip with a fire tower summit. Long but no technical sections. Bring extra water for both of you.</p><p><strong>12. Zealand Falls</strong> - The 5.5-mile round trip to the AMC hut and falls is moderate and dog-friendly. Can extend to Zealand and other peaks if your dog is fit.</p>"
