    "introduction": "<p>Half Dome gets all the attention, but many Yosemite veterans will tell you Clouds Rest is the better hike. At 9,926 feet, this granite summit offers panoramic views that actually include Half Dome—looking across at its famous face from a perspective most visitors never see. And unlike Half Dome, Clouds Rest doesn't require a permit lottery to climb.</p><p>The views from Clouds Rest are genuinely extraordinary: Half Dome, Tenaya Canyon, the Cathedral Range, and the Yosemite Valley spread beneath you. It's one of the finest summit experiences in California.</p>",
