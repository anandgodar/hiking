    "introduction": "<p>Perched on the Tiburon Peninsula in Marin County, Ring Mountain is one of the Bay Area's best-kept secrets. This 377-acre preserve rises just 602 feet above sea level, but its open grasslands and rocky outcrops offer panoramic views of San Francisco, the Golden Gate, and the surrounding bay. Even better: it hosts endemic plant species found nowhere else on Earth.</p><p>While crowds descend on nearby Mount Tamalpais, Ring Mountain remains wonderfully quiet. The short trails make it perfect for a morning or evening outing, yet the views rival far more famous destinations.</p>",
