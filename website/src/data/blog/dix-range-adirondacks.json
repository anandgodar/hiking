    "introduction": "<p>The Dix Range traverse is the Adirondack peak-bagger's dream: five High Peaks—Macomb, South Dix, Grace, Hough, and Dix—connected by a spectacular ridgeline that can be completed in a single ambitious day. It's challenging, with 17+ miles and over 6,000 feet of elevation gain, but for strong hikers, it's the most efficient way to knock out five summits from the 46.</p><p>Beyond the numbers, the Dix Range offers some of the finest hiking in the Adirondacks. The views from Dix's open summit are legendary, and the ridge traverse provides above-treeline hiking matched only by the Great Range.</p>",

        "content": "<h3>Macomb Mountain (4,405 ft)</h3><p>The approach via the Macomb Slide provides early views and introduces the range's character. The slide is steep with loose rock—take care. Most hikers find Macomb surprisingly challenging for a first peak.</p><h3>South Dix (4,060 ft)</h3><p>A forested summit with limited views, but an easy add from Macomb. The trail connecting them is rugged but manageable.</p><h3>Grace Peak (4,012 ft)</h3><p>The most remote of the five, Grace requires bushwhacking from the main trail. It's a \"trail-less peak\"—no maintained path to the summit. Navigation skills required.</p><h3>Hough Peak (4,400 ft)</h3><p>Named for a former state surveyor, Hough offers better views than South Dix or Grace. The climb from the col is a significant effort.</p><h3>Dix Mountain (4,857 ft)</h3><p>The finale: Dix's open summit provides some of the best views in the Adirondacks. On a clear day, you can see the Great Range, Mount Marcy, and seemingly half of the 46. It's worth lingering.</p>"

You should be comfortable with:</p><ul><li>Full-day mountain hikes of 12+ hours</li><li>Sustained elevation gain (6,000+ feet)</li><li>Rough, unmaintained terrain</li><li>Basic bushwhacking (for Grace Peak)</li></ul><h3>When to Go</h3><ul><li><strong>June-September:</strong> Best conditions; longest days</li><li><strong>Fall:</strong> Shorter days but stunning foliage</li><li><strong>Winter:</strong> Full winter mountaineering expedition</li></ul><h3>Overnight Option</h3><p>Breaking the traverse into two days is sensible for many hikers. Camp in the col between peaks (follow regulations) or use the Elk Lake Lodge for a base.</p>"
