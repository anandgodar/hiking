    "introduction": "<p>Baxter State Park isn't just about Katahdin. Yes, Maine's highest peak dominates the southern end of the park and draws thousands of hikers each year. But this 209,644-acre wilderness holds so much more: over 40 peaks, 175+ miles of trails, pristine ponds, moose-filled marshes, and a commitment to wilderness preservation that makes it unlike any other park in the Northeast.</p><p>Baxter was a gift from former Governor Percival Baxter, who spent decades buying up land and deeding it to the state with one condition: it must remain 'forever wild.' That mission continues today. There's no cell service, limited facilities, and strict regulations—all in service of preserving a genuine wilderness experience.</p>",

        "content": "<h3>The Setting</h3><p>Baxter State Park encompasses 209,644 acres in north-central Maine, surrounding Mount Katahdin and the northern end of the Appalachian Trail. The park contains 46 mountain peaks and ridges, 18 of them over 3,000 feet.</p><h3>The Wilderness Ethic</h3><p>Baxter operates differently from most parks. There's no electricity (solar only at some facilities), no running water, limited cell service, and strict regulations on group size and activities. This isn't bureaucracy—it's intentional wilderness preservation. Come prepared to disconnect.</p><h3>Key Regulations</h3><ul><li>Reservations required for camping and day-use parking</li><li>No pets allowed anywhere in the park</li><li>No motorcycles or ATVs</li><li>Commercial vehicles prohibited</li><li>Groups limited to 12 people</li></ul>"

Less crowded than Katahdin with similar rewards.</p><h3>The Traveler Loop</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 10.5 miles</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 3,900 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Very Strenuous</li></ul><p>In the park's less-visited northern section, the Traveler is a volcanic remnant with dramatic terrain. The loop traverses multiple peaks with views across the northern wilderness.</p><h3>South Turner Mountain</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 4.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,600 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>The classic Katahdin viewpoint. From South Turner's summit, the entire Katahdin massif spreads before you. Perfect for days when Katahdin itself is clouded in or you want a shorter hike.</p><h3>North Brother</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 8.6 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,900 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>The highest of the Brothers peaks, with excellent views and far fewer hikers than Katahdin. The Marston Trail approach offers a true wilderness experience.</p>"
