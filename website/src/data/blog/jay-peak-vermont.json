    "introduction": "<p>Jay Peak rises dramatically near Vermont's northern border, its distinctive rocky summit visible from miles around. At 3,858 feet, it's not among Vermont's highest, but its isolated position and rugged character make it one of the state's most rewarding climbs.</p><p>The Long Trail passes over Jay Peak just 3 miles before reaching the Canadian border—making this the dramatic final act for northbound thru-hikers. For day hikers, it offers challenging terrain, excellent views into Quebec, and a taste of Vermont's wildest corner.</p>",
