    "introduction": "<p>In a state known for forested summits, Saddleback Mountain stands apart. This 4,120-foot peak in the Rangeley region boasts nearly two miles of exposed alpine ridge—the most extensive above-treeline hiking in Maine outside of Katahdin. Thru-hikers on the Appalachian Trail often cite this stretch as one of the finest sections of the entire 2,190-mile trail.</p><p>The Saddleback massif includes three peaks over 4,000 feet: Saddleback itself, The Horn (4,041 ft), and Saddleback Junior (4,023 ft). A traverse of the full ridge is one of Maine's great hiking adventures, offering alpine scenery that rivals the White Mountains without the crowds.</p>",

You'll climb Saddleback, cross to The Horn, continue to Saddleback Junior, and descend through forest to the northern trailhead. This requires a car shuttle but delivers the complete experience.</p><h3>Saddleback Only (Out and Back)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 10.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,600 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>From Route 4, hike the AT northbound to Saddleback's summit and return the same way. You'll get the main peak and excellent alpine views without the full traverse logistics.</p><h3>From Saddleback Ski Area</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 5.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,000 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate-Strenuous</li></ul><p>The shortest route, starting higher at the ski area base. The trail follows service roads and ski trails before joining the AT for the final climb. Good option if you want alpine views without the full commitment.</p>"

Unlike peaks where you emerge above treeline only briefly, Saddleback offers extended time in fragile, beautiful terrain:</p><ul><li><strong>Alpine plants:</strong> Labrador tea, alpine azalea, diapensia, and other rare plants cling to the exposed rocks</li><li><strong>360-degree views:</strong> From the ridge, you can see Sugarloaf and the Bigelow Range, Rangeley Lake, the western mountains, and on clear days, Katahdin</li><li><strong>Mountain tarns:</strong> Small ponds dot the ridge, adding beauty and reflecting the sky</li><li><strong>The Horn's rocky summit:</strong> A dramatic point along the traverse with some of the best views</li></ul><p>The alpine zone here is fragile. Stay on marked trails and bare rock—these plants take decades to recover from trampling.</p>"

That alpine ridge—exposed, beautiful, and wild—delivers an experience more commonly associated with the western mountains. If you're looking for something special and don't mind earning it, Saddleback should be on your list.</p>",
