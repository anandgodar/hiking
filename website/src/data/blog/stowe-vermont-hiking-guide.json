        "heading": "Smugglers' Notch Area",
        "content": "<p>The dramatic mountain pass between Stowe and Jeffersonville is a destination in itself. Route 108 climbs through massive boulders—some as big as houses—that have fallen from the cliffs above.</p><h3>Big Spring</h3><p>A short walk from the road leads to a powerful spring gushing from the mountainside—cold, clear water that's been filtering through rock for years.</p><h3>Smugglers' Cave</h3><p>A short scramble up from the road leads to a rock cave with views down into the notch. The bouldering here is popular with climbers.</p><h3>Route 108 Note</h3><p>The notch road is steep, narrow, and winding—RVs and trailers are prohibited. It closes for winter, typically November through May. Check conditions before planning a trip that requires driving through.</p>"
