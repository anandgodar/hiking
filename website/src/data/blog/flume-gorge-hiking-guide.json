    "introduction": "<p>Flume Gorge is one of those places that feels like it shouldn't exist—an 800-foot chasm with granite walls rising 70-90 feet on either side, a stream rushing through the bottom, and boardwalks that let you walk right through the heart of it. Discovered in 1808 by a local woman searching for trout, it's been drawing visitors ever since.</p><p>This isn't wilderness hiking—it's a developed attraction within Franconia Notch State Park, with a visitor center, admission fee, and well-maintained paths. But don't let that deter you. The gorge itself is a genuine natural wonder, and the 2-mile loop delivers waterfalls, covered bridges, and mountain views alongside the main attraction.</p>",

You'll follow a series of boardwalks, bridges, and trails through the forest before entering the gorge itself.</p><p>Inside the gorge, the boardwalk hugs the walls above Flume Brook, passing moss-covered rocks, ferns, and the rushing water below. It's a sensory experience—the sound of the water, the cool air, the sheer scale of the granite walls.</p><p>The trail continues past Avalanche Falls (a 45-foot cascade), through a covered bridge, and past several viewpoints before returning to the visitor center.</p>"
