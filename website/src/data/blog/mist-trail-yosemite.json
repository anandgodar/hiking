    "introduction": "<p>The Mist Trail earns its name: during peak flow, hikers climbing to Vernal Falls pass directly through the waterfall's spray, emerging soaked but exhilarated. This iconic Yosemite trail showcases two of the park's most impressive waterfalls—317-foot Vernal Falls and 594-foot Nevada Falls—along with granite scenery that defines the Sierra Nevada.</p><p>It's one of the most popular trails in America, and for good reason. The combination of towering waterfalls, granite staircases, and emerald pools creates an experience that stays with hikers forever.</p>",

Granite stairs—over 600 of them—climb alongside Vernal Falls through constant spray. The viewpoint at the top reveals the Emerald Pool and continuing canyon.</p><h3>To Nevada Falls (Top)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 7.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,900 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>Continue past Vernal to Nevada Falls, where the river plunges 594 feet in a massive drop. The extended hike rewards with even more dramatic scenery and usually fewer crowds than the lower section.</p><h3>Mist Trail/John Muir Trail Loop</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 8.0 miles loop</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,900 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>Ascend via Mist Trail, descend via John Muir Trail (or vice versa). The JMT offers a drier alternative with equally stunning views.</p>"

In peak flow (May-June), you will get soaked. Embrace it:</p><ul><li>Wear quick-dry clothing</li><li>Bring a rain jacket (or don't—it's warm)</li><li>Protect cameras in waterproof bags</li><li>Watch your footing on wet rock</li></ul><h3>Emerald Pool</h3><p>At the top of Vernal Falls, the river spreads into the beautiful Emerald Pool. Swimming is prohibited due to the dangerous current, but the views are rewarding.</p><h3>Nevada Falls Viewpoint</h3><p>The wide granite apron of Nevada Falls creates one of Yosemite's most photogenic scenes. The Liberty Cap granite dome provides dramatic backdrop.</p>"

The only ways to avoid masses are very early starts (before 7 AM) or weekday visits.</p>"

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>Wet rocks:</strong> The granite stairs are slippery when wet—take your time</li><li><strong>Fatalities:</strong> People die here every year, usually from going off-trail near water. Stay on established paths.</li><li><strong>Heat:</strong> Summer temperatures can be brutal; bring plenty of water</li><li><strong>Altitude:</strong> Starting elevation is 4,000 feet—elevation effects possible</li></ul><h3>Swimming Dangers</h3><p>The pools above waterfalls are deadly. Strong currents have swept people over the falls. Swimming is prohibited for good reason—respect the closures.</p>"
