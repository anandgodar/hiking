    "introduction": "<p>Ask Adirondack hikers about their favorite summit, and Haystack comes up again and again. At 4,960 feet, it's the third-highest peak in New York, but it's the summit experience—a narrow rock cone with unobstructed views in every direction—that earns its reputation. Many consider it the finest viewpoint in the entire Northeast.</p><p>Haystack isn't easy to reach. All routes are long and involve significant elevation gain. But for those willing to put in the miles, Haystack delivers a mountain experience that stays with you forever.</p>",

        "heading": "Combining with Other Peaks",
        "content": "<h3>Haystack + Marcy</h3><p>Many hikers combine Haystack with Mount Marcy, since the trails intersect at Four Corners. This adds mileage but bags the two highest peaks in a single push.</p><h3>Haystack + Basin</h3><p>The Johns Brook approach naturally includes Basin Mountain. Adding Little Haystack as well makes for an efficient day of peak-bagging.</p><h3>Multi-Day Option</h3><p>Staying at Johns Brook Lodge (reservations required) breaks the distance into manageable chunks and allows for a more relaxed pace. The lodge serves meals and provides bunks—a welcome comfort after a long day.</p>"
