    "introduction": "<p>You can see Camel's Hump from Burlington, from Montpelier, from seemingly half of Vermont. That distinctive profile—a bump rising to a sharp summit—is as recognizable as any mountain in New England. The Abenaki people called it 'Tah-wah-be-dee-ee-wadso,' the mountain that sits like a seat. Samuel de Champlain marked it on his 1609 map as 'le lion couchant'—the lying lion.</p><p>Whatever you call it, Camel's Hump is one of Vermont's essential hikes. At 4,083 feet, it's the state's third-highest peak and one of only two Vermont mountains (along with Mansfield) with true alpine tundra. Unlike Mansfield, there's no road or gondola—you earn every foot of elevation gain on foot.</p><p>And that's part of its charm. Camel's Hump feels wild, even with its popularity. The approach through Camel's Hump State Park, the rocky summit scramble, the tiny alpine plants clinging to existence—it all adds up to a quintessential Vermont mountain experience.</p>",

        "content": "<h3>Burley Trail (East Side)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 5.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,200 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 4-5 hours</li></ul><p>The shortest and most direct route, climbing steadily from the east. The trail crosses through mixed forest before steepening for the final push to the summit. Well-maintained and well-marked, with good footing most of the way.</p><h3>Monroe Trail (West Side)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 6.6 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,600 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 5-6 hours</li></ul><p>Starting from the Couching Lion Farm in Huntington, Monroe Trail climbs through beautiful hardwood forest before meeting the Long Trail just below the alpine zone. Slightly longer but often less crowded than Burley.</p><h3>Long Trail from Winooski Valley</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 8.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,800 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 6-8 hours</li></ul><p>Approach from the north, following the Long Trail south from Route 2. This is the longest standard route but offers the most continuous trail experience, passing through varied terrain.</p><h3>Loop Options</h3><p>With a car shuttle, you can combine routes for a traverse. Monroe up, Burley down (or vice versa) makes for a varied day.</p>"

        "heading": "The Climb",
        "content": "<h3>In the Forest</h3><p>All routes begin in the forest, climbing through Vermont's classic northern hardwoods—sugar maple, yellow birch, beech. As you gain elevation, spruce and fir take over, the trees shrinking until finally giving way to wind-blasted krummholz (stunted, twisted trees).</p><p>The transition from forest to alpine is gradual but unmistakable. Pay attention to the plants changing around you—it's a journey through ecological zones, from temperate forest to conditions that exist otherwise only in Arctic Canada.</p><h3>The Alpine Zone</h3><p>Above treeline, you enter one of Vermont's two true alpine areas. The plants here are tiny, tough, and ancient—some communities are thousands of years old. They survive in a harsh environment of brutal winters, short growing seasons, and constant wind.</p><p><strong>Stay on the rocks.</strong> Even careful footsteps can destroy years of plant growth. The trails are marked with rock cairns; follow them precisely.</p><h3>The Summit</h3><p>Camel's Hump's summit is a small rocky area that feels bigger than its size because of the 360-degree views. On clear days you can see:</p><ul><li>Mount Mansfield to the north</li><li>Lake Champlain and the Adirondacks to the west</li><li>The Worcester Range to the east</li><li>The Green Mountain spine stretching south</li></ul>"

Limited capacity—arrive early on weekends.</li><li><strong>Monroe Trail:</strong> Park at the Couching Lion Farm lot. Donation requested.</li></ul><h3>Dogs</h3><p>Allowed on leash, but the alpine zone presents challenges. Dogs can damage fragile vegetation, and the rocky scrambling can be difficult for some dogs. Use good judgment.</p><h3>Facilities</h3><p>Primitive composting privy at the summit. No water sources—bring everything you need.</p><h3>Conditions</h3><p>The upper mountain is significantly colder and windier than the base. Bring layers year-round. The summit can be clouded in even when valleys are clear—check forecasts but be prepared for weather changes.</p>"

Alpine flowers peak in mid-June.</li><li><strong>Late September:</strong> Fall colors are spectacular, especially from the summit.</li><li><strong>May:</strong> Snow may linger; trails can be muddy and closed for 'mud season.'</li></ul><h3>Mud Season Closure</h3><p>Vermont's Green Mountains have a voluntary mud season closure, typically mid-April through Memorial Day. High-elevation trails are particularly vulnerable when saturated; please respect closures to protect trail surfaces.</p><h3>Winter</h3><p>Camel's Hump is a popular winter objective, but don't underestimate it. Full winter gear is essential—crampons, ice axe, insulating layers. The alpine zone in winter is arctic-like, with extreme cold and wind. Only experienced winter hikers should attempt it.</p>"

The alpine plants are irreplaceable.</li></ul>"
