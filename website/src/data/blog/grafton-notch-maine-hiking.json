    "introduction": "<p>Tucked into the mountains along Route 26 near the New Hampshire border, Grafton Notch State Park doesn't get the attention of Acadia or Baxter, but hikers in the know consider it one of Maine's finest outdoor destinations. The park sits in a dramatic mountain pass surrounded by the rugged Mahoosuc Range, with waterfalls, caves, and trails ranging from 10-minute strolls to all-day mountain adventures.</p><p>Old Speck Mountain, Maine's third-highest peak at 4,180 feet, anchors the park's western edge. But you don't need to climb a 4,000-footer to find spectacular scenery here—some of the best views come from much shorter hikes to places like Table Rock and Mother Walker Falls.</p>",

        "content": "<h3>Screw Auger Falls</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 0.2 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy (wheelchair accessible to viewing area)</li></ul><p>A 25-foot waterfall that plunges through a narrow granite gorge carved by centuries of erosion. The 'screw auger' name comes from the corkscrew pattern worn into the rock. This is a quick roadside stop that shouldn't be missed.</p><h3>Mother Walker Falls</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 0.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</li></ul><p>A short walk leads to this 100-foot cascade that flows through a narrow gorge. Best viewed after rain or during spring snowmelt.</p><h3>Moose Cave</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 0.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</li></ul><p>A deep gorge with overhanging walls that create a cave-like environment. The cool, damp interior feels like another world on a hot summer day.</p>"

        "heading": "Table Rock",
        "content": "<ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 900 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 1.5-2.5 hours</li></ul><p>Table Rock is the signature hike of Grafton Notch—a flat-topped rock platform perched on a cliff edge with dramatic views down into the notch and across to Old Speck Mountain.</p><p>The trail climbs steadily through forest before emerging onto open ledges. The final approach involves some scrambling over slabs, but nothing technical. At the top, the flat rock 'table' provides an ideal spot for lunch with a view.</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Continue on the Appalachian Trail another 0.3 miles to reach Baldpate Mountain's summit for even more expansive views.</p>"

The Old Speck Trail (which coincides with the Appalachian Trail) climbs steadily from the parking area, passing through beautiful forest with occasional views before reaching the wooded summit.</p><p>An observation tower on top provides 360-degree views above the trees—essential since the summit itself is forested. On clear days, you can see Katahdin to the north and Mount Washington to the southwest.</p><h3>The Mahoosuc Arm</h3><p>For a longer adventure, continue on the AT over the Mahoosuc Arm to Mahoosuc Notch—often called the hardest mile of the entire Appalachian Trail. This boulder-choked ravine requires climbing over, under, and between massive rocks. Only for experienced hikers with a full day.</p>"

The Eyebrow Trail traverses dramatic cliff faces with some exposed scrambling and ladder sections.</p><p>Most hikers go up the Eyebrow Trail and down the AT. The cliff views from the Eyebrow are spectacular, but the exposure may not suit everyone.</p>"
