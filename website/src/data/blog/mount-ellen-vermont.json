    "introduction": "<p>Mount Ellen rises to 4,083 feet in the heart of Vermont's Green Mountains—the state's third-highest peak and crown of the Sugarbush ski area. While neighboring Lincoln Peak gets more skier attention, Ellen is the higher summit and a worthy hiking destination in its own right.</p><p>The Long Trail traverses Ellen's summit, offering through-hikers and section hikers a significant peak without detour. For day hikers, various approaches provide options from short (via ski area) to epic (full ridge traverse from Lincoln Gap).</p>",
