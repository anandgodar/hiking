Maybe you just moved to New England and want to explore what all the fuss is about.</p><p>Whatever your reason, New Hampshire is a great place to start hiking.

        "content": "<h3>1. Artist Bluff & Bald Mountain</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 1.5 miles (loop)</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 350 feet</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> Franconia Notch</li></ul><p>This might be the best \"bang for your buck\" hike in New Hampshire. A short climb leads to stunning views of Franconia Ridge, Echo Lake, and Cannon Mountain. The trail is rocky in places but manageable for most people. Perfect for your first White Mountains experience.</p><h3>2. Sabbaday Falls</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 0.6 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 100 feet</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> Kancamagus Highway</li></ul><p>An almost-flat paved trail to a beautiful waterfall. Ideal for families with young children, seniors, or anyone who wants an easy forest walk with a rewarding destination. Great for a quick stop while driving the Kanc.</p><h3>3. Lincoln Woods Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.8 miles round trip (to suspension bridge)</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> Minimal</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> Kancamagus Highway</li></ul><p>A wide, flat trail along an old railroad bed following the Pemigewasset River.

Lonesome Lake via Basin-Cascades Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 3.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 950 feet</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> Franconia Notch</li></ul><p>A beautiful mountain lake with views of Franconia Ridge.

        "content": "<h3>5. Mount Willard</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 3.2 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 900 feet</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> Crawford Notch</li></ul><p>If you can only do one beginner hike in NH, make it Mount Willard. A relatively easy climb leads to one of the most dramatic viewpoints in the state—looking straight down into Crawford Notch with mountains rising on both sides. The views are out of proportion to the effort.</p><p><strong>Don't miss:</strong> The historic Crawford Depot at the trailhead, with restrooms and visitor info.</p><h3>6. Mount Pemigewasset (Indian Head)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 3.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,150 feet</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> Franconia Notch</li></ul><p>A steady climb to open ledges with views of Franconia Ridge, Cannon Mountain, and the notch below. The summit rock profile is said to look like an Indian head in profile. A great introduction to above-treeline hiking without the extreme exposure of bigger peaks.</p><h3>7. Cascade Path (Waterville Valley)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 500 feet</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> Waterville Valley</li></ul><p>A gentle forest walk following Cascade Brook to several small but pretty waterfalls. The trail is well-maintained and never too steep. Perfect for a relaxed morning hike with waterfall rewards.</p><h3>8. Mount Major</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 3.6 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,100 feet</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> Alton Bay</li></ul><p>One of the most popular hikes in the Lakes Region, with spectacular views of Lake Winnipesaukee from the summit. Several routes available—the main trail is steady but manageable. Can be crowded on nice weekends.</p>"

Mount Cardigan (West Ridge Trail)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 3.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,220 feet</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> Orange</li></ul><p>A bald summit with 360-degree views, but without the crowds of Mount Monadnock. The West Ridge Trail is the shortest route, with open ledges near the top that give you a taste of above-treeline hiking. Great preparation for bigger things.</p><h3>10. Mount Kearsarge (from Winslow State Park)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.2 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,100 feet</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> Warner</li></ul><p>A short but rewarding climb to a fire tower with panoramic views. The trail from Winslow State Park is steeper but shorter than the Rollins State Park alternative. Both options offer great views for relatively little effort.</p><h3>11. Rattlesnake Mountain (West Rattlesnake)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 1.8 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 450 feet</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> Holderness</li></ul><p>A short climb to open ledges overlooking Squam Lake (the filming location for \"On Golden Pond\"). One of the best view-to-effort ratios in NH. Perfect for sunset hikes.</p><h3>12. Mount Israel</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 4.2 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,700 feet</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> Sandwich</li></ul><p>A steady climb through beautiful forest to a summit with views of the Sandwich Range. Quieter than many popular trails. The Wentworth Trail is the standard route.</p>"

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>Start early and plan more time than you think.</strong> A trail that takes experienced hikers 2 hours might take you 3-4 hours. That's totally fine.</li><li><strong>Bring more water than you think you need.</strong> A liter per hour of hiking is a good rule of thumb.</li><li><strong>Wear proper footwear.</strong> You don't need expensive hiking boots for easy trails, but running shoes or sandals won't cut it. Trail shoes with good grip are ideal.</li><li><strong>Tell someone your plan.</strong> Even on easy trails, let someone know where you're going and when you expect to be back.</li><li><strong>Check the weather.</strong> Mountain weather can change quickly. If thunderstorms are forecast, save the summit hikes for another day.</li><li><strong>Pack layers.</strong> Summits are often 10-15 degrees cooler than trailheads, and weather can change.</li><li><strong>Bring snacks.</strong> Hiking is hungry work. Trail mix, bars, sandwiches—whatever keeps you fueled.</li></ul>"

Focus on enjoying the experience, not pushing your limits. Do 2-3 hikes.</p><h3>Month 3-4</h3><p>Move to moderate trails: Mount Willard, Mount Pemigewasset, Lonesome Lake. These have more climbing but are still manageable. Your legs will adapt.</p><h3>Month 5-6</h3><p>Try the stepping stone hikes: Cardigan, Kearsarge, Mount Major. These prepare you for bigger challenges.</p><h3>Beyond</h3><p>When these feel comfortable, you're ready for the next level: Welch-Dickey Loop, Mount Monadnock, and eventually the 4000-footers.</p>"
