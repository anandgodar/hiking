    "introduction": "<p>Hurricane Mountain rises at the eastern edge of the Adirondack High Peaks, offering a perspective that few other summits can match. From its restored fire tower, you look west to the entire High Peaks region spread before you, and east across the Champlain Valley to the Green Mountains of Vermont. The mountain's position makes it a perfect viewing platform.</p><p>At 3,694 feet, Hurricane isn't among the 46 High Peaks, but it offers one of the most satisfying hikes in the region: challenging enough to feel earned, short enough for a half-day, and rewarding enough to bring you back again and again.</p>",

The trail climbs steadily through mixed hardwood forest, with the grade increasing as you approach the summit. Several open ledges along the way provide rest spots with views. The final push to the summit is steeper but short.</p><h3>East Trail (From Hurricane Road)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 6.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,700 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>This route approaches from the east, starting higher but covering more distance. It's less popular and offers more solitude. The trails can be combined for a traverse with a car shuttle.</p>"

        "heading": "The Fire Tower",
        "content": "<p>Hurricane's fire tower was built in 1919 and is one of the best-preserved in the Adirondacks. The 35-foot steel tower is open to hikers, and climbing it is strongly recommended—the views from the cab are significantly better than from ground level.</p><h3>The View</h3><p>From the tower platform:</p><ul><li><strong>West:</strong> The entire High Peaks region—Giant, the Great Range, Marcy, Algonquin</li><li><strong>East:</strong> Lake Champlain and Vermont's Green Mountains</li><li><strong>North:</strong> Whiteface Mountain and the northern Adirondacks</li><li><strong>South:</strong> Dix Range and the southern High Peaks</li></ul><p>On clear days, the view extends over 100 miles. This is arguably the best fire tower view in the Adirondacks, combining proximity to the High Peaks with the contrasting perspective of Lake Champlain and Vermont.</p>"
