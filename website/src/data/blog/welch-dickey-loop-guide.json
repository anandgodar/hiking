    "introduction": "<p>If you've ever scrolled through hiking photos and seen people standing on dramatic open ledges with mountains stretching into the distance, there's a good chance you were looking at Welch-Dickey Loop.</p><p>This 4.4-mile loop in Waterville Valley has become one of the most popular hikes in New Hampshire—and for good reason. It delivers the dramatic exposed ridge experience that usually requires twice the effort, all in a manageable half-day hike that intermediate hikers can handle.</p><p>I've done Welch-Dickey probably a dozen times over the years, and I still get excited every time I break out onto those open ledges. Here's everything you need to know to plan your trip.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 4.4 miles (loop)</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,800 feet</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 3-5 hours</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate (with some steep sections)</li><li><strong>Two Peaks:</strong> Welch Mountain (2,605') and Dickey Mountain (2,734')</li></ul><p>Neither Welch nor Dickey are 4000-footers, but don't let that fool you. This hike punches well above its weight class when it comes to views and scenery. The extensive open ledges give you the kind of experience usually reserved for much bigger mountains.</p>"

        "heading": "Why Everyone Loves This Hike",
        "content": "<h3>The Ledges</h3><p>About 40% of this hike is on open granite ledges with unobstructed views. You'll feel exposed to the sky in the best possible way, with views of Franconia Ridge, the Sandwich Range, and the Mad River Valley.</p><h3>The Loop Format</h3><p>There's something satisfying about a loop hike—no retracing your steps, always new terrain. The Welch-Dickey Loop delivers this perfectly, with each mountain offering a distinct character.</p><h3>The Accessibility</h3><p>This is a hike that intermediate hikers can accomplish, yet experienced hikers still enjoy. It's challenging enough to feel like an achievement without being an all-day death march.</p><h3>The Photo Ops</h3><p>Let's be honest: this trail is ridiculously photogenic. Every turn seems to offer another Instagram-worthy vista.</p>"

        "heading": "Which Direction: Welch First or Dickey First?",
        "content": "<h3>Welch First (Counter-Clockwise)</h3><p>This is the more popular direction, and it's what I recommend for most hikers:</p><ul><li>The initial climb up Welch is steep but shorter</li><li>You hit the best ledges earlier in the hike</li><li>The descent off Dickey is more gradual</li><li>You'll be hiking into the sun on the exposed sections (better for photos)</li></ul><h3>Dickey First (Clockwise)</h3><p>Some prefer this direction because:</p><ul><li>The climb up Dickey is more gradual</li><li>You save the dramatic Welch ledges for the end</li><li>Fewer people going this direction = less passing on narrow ledges</li></ul><p>Honestly, you can't go wrong either way. I slightly prefer Welch first, but both directions are excellent.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>Going Counter-Clockwise (Welch First)</h3><p><strong>Mile 0-0.7:</strong> The trail climbs steadily through hardwood forest. Nothing too dramatic, just a good warmup.</p><p><strong>Mile 0.7-1.2:</strong> Things get steeper as you approach the ledges. There are a few rock scrambles that require using your hands, but nothing technical.</p><p><strong>Mile 1.2-1.7:</strong> The first open ledges appear, and suddenly the whole valley opens up below you. This section is pure magic—extensive granite slabs with views that seem to go forever. You'll understand why everyone raves about this hike.</p><p><strong>Mile 1.7:</strong> Welch Mountain summit. Not much of a defined peak, but great views. Take a break and enjoy.</p><p><strong>Mile 1.7-2.7:</strong> The ridge walk between Welch and Dickey. More open ledges, more views, more smiling. This is the heart of the hike.</p><p><strong>Mile 2.7:</strong> Dickey Mountain summit. Slightly higher than Welch with great views toward the Sandwich Range.</p><p><strong>Mile 2.7-4.4:</strong> The descent. Initially open ledges, then forest walking. The grade is gentler than the Welch side, which your knees will appreciate.</p>"

        "heading": "Important Safety Considerations",
        "content": "<h3>The Ledges Can Be Dangerous</h3><p>The open granite ledges are beautiful, but they require respect:</p><ul><li><strong>When wet:</strong> The rock becomes incredibly slippery. People have been seriously injured sliding on wet ledges. If it's raining or recently rained, consider postponing.</li><li><strong>When icy:</strong> Even a thin layer of ice makes the ledges treacherous. Microspikes are essential in winter/early spring.</li><li><strong>Strong winds:</strong> With no trees for protection, you're fully exposed on the ledges. High winds can make it hard to stand.</li></ul><h3>Not for Young Children</h3><p>I see families attempt this hike with small children, and it often doesn't go well. The ledges have significant exposure in places, and there are several spots where a fall would be serious. I'd recommend waiting until kids are at least 10-12 and comfortable with heights.</p><h3>Dogs Need Caution</h3><p>Dogs can do this hike, but the ledges can be hard on their paws and some scrambles are difficult for dogs. Keep them leashed—the exposure makes off-leash hiking risky.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>Best Seasons</h3><p><strong>Late May through October</strong> is the sweet spot. The trail can be done earlier or later, but conditions become more challenging.</p><ul><li><strong>Spring (May-June):</strong> Watch for icy patches on north-facing sections. Mud season can be messy on the forest sections.</li><li><strong>Summer (July-August):</strong> Prime time. Early starts avoid the heat on exposed ledges.</li><li><strong>Fall (September-October):</strong> Spectacular foliage views. Can be crowded during peak leaf season.</li><li><strong>Winter:</strong> Beautiful but requires microspikes/crampons and winter hiking experience. The ledges are no joke when icy.</li></ul><h3>Best Time of Day</h3><p>Start early—by 7 or 8 AM on weekends. The parking lot fills up fast on nice days, and starting early gets you on the ledges before the crowds and heat.</p>"

Overflow parking along the road when lot is full.</li><li><strong>Fee:</strong> $5 (cash or check, honor system)</li><li><strong>Facilities:</strong> None at trailhead. Use restrooms at the Waterville Valley town square before arriving.</li></ul><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If the lot is full, don't be that person who blocks the road.
