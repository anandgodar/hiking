    "introduction": "<p>Giant Mountain rises 4,627 feet above the Champlain Valley, its massive bulk visible from Route 9 for miles in either direction. The Adirondack natives called it 'Giant of the Valley,' and the name fits—this mountain dominates its surroundings in a way few others do.</p><p>But what really sets Giant apart is the summit view. The peak's eastern face drops away dramatically, offering an unobstructed panorama across Lake Champlain to Vermont's Green Mountains and beyond. Many experienced Adirondack hikers consider it one of the finest viewpoints in the entire range.</p><p>The climb is substantial—over 3,000 feet of elevation gain—but the rewards match the effort. Giant earns its spot on any serious Adirondack hiking list.</p>",

The trail begins moderately but steepens significantly in the upper half, with several rocky sections requiring hands-on scrambling.</p><h3>Ridge Trail from Route 9N</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 6.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 3,400 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 5-7 hours</li></ul><p>A slightly longer approach from the east with more consistent views along the ridge.

        "heading": "The Climb: Roaring Brook Trail",
        "content": "<h3>Chapel Pond to Giant Washbowl (1.5 miles)</h3><p>The trail starts with a moderate climb through mixed forest, crossing Roaring Brook early on. After about 1.5 miles, you'll reach the Giant Washbowl—a beautiful mountain pond cupped in a small cirque. This makes a nice rest stop and turnaround point for those seeking a shorter hike.</p><h3>Washbowl to Summit (1.6 miles)</h3><p>Above the Washbowl, the real climbing begins. The trail steepens dramatically, with rock scrambles and exposed sections requiring attention. You'll gain over 2,000 feet in less than 2 miles.</p><p>The upper mountain opens up with views west toward the Great Range. The final approach to the summit involves some ledge walking with drop-offs—thrilling but requiring care.</p><h3>The Summit</h3><p>Giant's summit is relatively open, with the dramatic eastern cliff providing the signature view. Lake Champlain stretches below, with Vermont's Green Mountains forming the horizon. On clear days, you can see Mount Mansfield, Camel's Hump, and even hints of the White Mountains beyond.</p><p>To the west, the heart of the High Peaks spreads out—Marcy, Haystack, the Great Range—offering perspective on the surrounding wilderness.</p>"

Look for the parking area on the east side of the road.</p><h3>Parking</h3><p>The Chapel Pond parking lot is small and fills early on summer weekends—often by 7 AM. Options:</p><ul><li>Arrive very early</li><li>Use the Chapel Pond overflow lot (adds road walking)</li><li>Hike on weekdays</li><li>Consider the Route 9N trailhead as an alternative</li></ul><h3>Permit/Registration</h3><p>No permit required for day hiking, but you must register at the trailhead kiosk.</p>"

Full traction gear and winter mountaineering skills required. The exposed summit ridge can be dangerous in high winds or whiteout conditions.</p>"
