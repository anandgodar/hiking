    "introduction": "<p>Mount Kineo is unlike any other hike in Maine. Rising dramatically from the waters of Moosehead Lake, this cliff-faced peninsula was sacred to the Penobscot people, who traveled here to collect flint for tools. The only way to reach it is by boat—adding an adventure-within-an-adventure quality that makes Kineo unforgettable.</p><p>The mountain itself is modest (1,806 feet above sea level, about 700 feet above the lake), but the setting is extraordinary. Sheer cliffs drop to the water on one side while trails wind through forest on the other, culminating in summit views across Maine's largest lake toward the mountains beyond.</p>",

        "content": "<p>You can't drive to Mount Kineo—that's part of its charm. Most hikers take the shuttle boat from Rockwood, a small town on Moosehead Lake's western shore:</p><ul><li><strong>Shuttle service:</strong> Runs from Rockwood village to Kineo dock (about 10 minutes)</li><li><strong>Cost:</strong> Approximately $15 round trip</li><li><strong>Schedule:</strong> Summer season, typically hourly departures</li><li><strong>Reservations:</strong> Walk-up is usually fine, but call ahead on busy weekends</li></ul><p>Alternatively, if you have your own boat or kayak, you can paddle across from Rockwood (about 0.75 miles). Kayaking adds another dimension to the adventure.</p>"

This is the trail Penobscot people traveled to reach the flint deposits. It's a proper workout but rewards with the fastest access to summit views.</p><h3>Bridle Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.5 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 700 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>A gentler grade makes this the easier option, though it's longer. Originally built as a horse path when the grand Kineo House hotel operated here, it switchbacks up the mountain's eastern slopes.</p><h3>Cliff Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> Variable</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</li></ul><p>Not a summit route, but worth exploring. This trail traces the base of Kineo's dramatic cliffs, offering impressive views up the rock face and across the lake.</p>"

You'll see:</p><ul><li>The lake spreading north and south, dotted with islands</li><li>Mount Katahdin on the horizon to the northeast (on clear days)</li><li>The dense Maine North Woods in every direction</li><li>Big Spencer Mountain and the surrounding peaks</li></ul><p>There's a fire tower at the summit (check if it's open to climb), and plenty of open rock for sitting and taking in the scenery. On a calm day, the silence is profound—just wind, water, and wilderness.</p>"

        "heading": "History and Significance",
        "content": "<p>Mount Kineo has been a destination for millennia. The Penobscot and other Wabanaki peoples considered it a sacred place, drawn by the rhyolite (flint-like volcanic rock) found here—ideal for making tools and weapons. Archaeological evidence suggests people visited Kineo at least 10,000 years ago.</p><p>In the late 1800s, the Kineo House hotel stood at the mountain's base, attracting wealthy vacationers who arrived by steamboat. The hotel burned down in 1938, but the golf course it created still operates seasonally.</p><p>Today, Kineo is part of a unique public/private ownership arrangement, with trails maintained by state and local efforts.</p>"
