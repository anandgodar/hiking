    "introduction": "<p>California's coastline is mostly developed, but one stretch remains wild. The Lost Coast got its name because Highway 1 couldn't conquer it—the mountains dropped too steeply to the sea. Today, that rugged geography preserves 25 miles of pristine beaches, black sand, marine wildlife, and the kind of solitude that's rare on any American coast.</p><p>The Lost Coast Trail is a bucket-list backpacking trip: camping on empty beaches, timing your passage with the tides, walking where the only other tracks are from seals and deer. It's challenging and logistically complex, but for those who complete it, utterly unforgettable.</p>",

Most hikers go north to south to have the wind and sun at their backs. The route follows the beach for most of its length, with some bluff detours where cliffs drop directly to the sea.</p><p>This isn't a maintained trail in the traditional sense—you're walking on sand, rocks, and gravel. It's slow going, and the terrain is constantly changing with tides and storms.</p>"

        "heading": "Tide Timing",
        "content": "<p>The Lost Coast's defining challenge is tidal passage. Several sections of the trail are impassable at high tide—waves crash directly against cliffs, leaving no way through. You must time your hiking with the tides.</p><h3>Impassable Zones</h3><p>Key areas that require tide timing:</p><ul><li>Punta Gorda to Sea Lion Gulch (most critical)</li><li>Miller Flat to Randall Creek</li><li>Big Flat to Shipman Creek</li></ul><h3>Planning Around Tides</h3><ul><li>Get a tide chart for your dates (available with permits)</li><li>Plan to cross impassable zones at tides of 1.5 feet or lower</li><li>Build flexibility into your itinerary</li><li>Never try to \"rush through\" a marginal tide—people have died</li></ul>"

The reward is constant ocean views and empty beaches.</p><h3>Wildlife</h3><p>The Lost Coast is rich with wildlife:</p><ul><li>Sea lions and harbor seals</li><li>Migrating gray whales (seasonal)</li><li>Black-tailed deer</li><li>Black bears (hence the canister requirement)</li><li>Abundant seabirds</li></ul><h3>Weather</h3><p>Be prepared for anything:</p><ul><li>Fog is common, even in summer</li><li>Wind can be fierce</li><li>Sun exposure is significant on cloudless days</li><li>Rain is possible any time of year</li></ul>"

The roads are winding and slow.</p><h3>Shuttle Services</h3><p>Since it's a one-way hike, you need transportation between trailheads. Options:</p><ul><li>Leave a car at each end (requires two vehicles)</li><li>Use a shuttle service (several operate locally)</li><li>Hitchhike (common and generally successful)</li></ul><h3>Best Times</h3><ul><li><strong>May-October:</strong> Driest weather; most reliable conditions</li><li><strong>Spring:</strong> Wildflowers but possibly wet</li><li><strong>Fall:</strong> Less fog, pleasant temperatures</li><li><strong>Winter:</strong> Storms make conditions dangerous</li></ul>"
