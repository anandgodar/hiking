    "introduction": "<p>There's a reason Mount Chocorua appears on countless postcards, calendars, and paintings. Standing alone at the southern edge of the White Mountains, its bare rocky summit rises sharply above the surrounding lakes and forests, creating what many consider the most beautiful mountain silhouette in New England.</p><p>At 3,490 feet, Chocorua isn't the tallest peak around—it doesn't even make the 4,000-footer list. But what it lacks in height, it makes up for in character. The open summit offers 360-degree views that rival peaks twice its elevation, and the variety of trail options means everyone from families with young kids to experienced hikers seeking a challenge can find their perfect route.</p>",

        "content": "<h3>Champney Falls Trail (Most Popular)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 7.6 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,250 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>This is the classic Chocorua route for good reason. You get a beautiful waterfall about 1.4 miles in—perfect for a snack break—before the trail climbs more steeply toward the summit. The upper section involves some fun scrambling over open ledges with views that keep getting better.</p><h3>Piper Trail (Shortest Route)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 4.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,150 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate-Strenuous</li></ul><p>If you want to reach the summit with the least mileage, Piper is your trail. The catch? It's steep and relentless. You'll gain elevation quickly, which some hikers love and others find exhausting. The rocky sections near the top require sure footing.</p><h3>Liberty Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 7.8 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,450 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate-Strenuous</li></ul><p>A quieter alternative that approaches from the west, passing Jim Liberty Cabin (an Appalachian Mountain Club shelter) along the way. Good option if you want to escape the Champney Falls crowds.</p>"

        "heading": "What to Expect on the Trail",
        "content": "<p>Chocorua's summit is completely exposed rock—a jumble of granite slabs with no trees to block the views or provide shade. On clear days, you can see Mount Washington to the north, the Lakes Region to the south, and seemingly endless forest in every direction.</p><p>The final approach involves Class 2 scrambling over rock ledges. It's not technical climbing, but you'll use your hands in places. Kids who are comfortable with heights generally love this section; those who aren't might find it intimidating.</p><p>A few things to know:</p><ul><li><strong>The summit gets crowded.</strong> Chocorua is one of the most popular hikes in New Hampshire. Start early or go midweek to avoid the masses.</li><li><strong>Weather changes fast.</strong> That exposed summit is incredible in good weather but brutal in storms. Check the forecast and turn around if conditions deteriorate.</li><li><strong>Bring extra water.</strong> The climb is more strenuous than the mileage suggests, and there's no shade on top.</li></ul>"

        "content": "<p>Chocorua is a three-season mountain for most hikers:</p><ul><li><strong>Late May through October:</strong> Prime hiking season. Expect the biggest crowds on summer weekends and during fall foliage.</li><li><strong>Fall foliage (late September-early October):</strong> The views are spectacular, but so are the crowds. Consider a weekday visit.</li><li><strong>Winter:</strong> Possible with microspikes and experience, but the exposed summit is extremely cold and windy. Not recommended for beginners.</li></ul>"

        "heading": "The Legend of Chocorua",
        "content": "<p>The mountain is named for Chief Chocorua, a Pequawket leader, and the legend is worth knowing. According to the story, Chocorua left his son with a settler family while away, but the boy accidentally consumed poison meant for foxes and died. When Chocorua returned and learned of his son's death, conflict ensued. Pursued to the mountain's summit, Chocorua reportedly cursed the land before falling to his death.</p><p>Whether historically accurate or not, the story adds a layer of meaning to the landscape. Many hikers pause at the summit to reflect on the indigenous peoples who lived here long before European settlement.</p>"

Arrive before 8 AM in summer, or prepare to park along the road.</p><h3>Fees</h3><p>A White Mountain National Forest parking pass is required ($5/day or $30/year).</p><h3>Dogs</h3><p>Dogs are allowed but must be leashed. The rocky scrambles near the summit can be challenging for dogs—know your pup's abilities.</p><h3>Facilities</h3><p>Pit toilets at the Champney Falls trailhead. No facilities on the mountain.</p>"
