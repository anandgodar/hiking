    "introduction": "<p>Killington Peak stands at the crossroads of Vermont hiking history. Here, the Appalachian Trail and Long Trail share the same path before diverging—the AT heading east toward New Hampshire, the LT continuing north toward Canada. At 4,235 feet, it's Vermont's second-highest summit, topped only by Mount Mansfield.</p><p>A fire tower on the summit provides 360-degree views across central Vermont, from the Adirondacks to the White Mountains. And while Killington is famous as a ski resort, the hiking trails offer a completely different experience—forested approaches giving way to rocky alpine terrain and expansive vistas.</p>",

The trail meets the Long Trail just below Cooper Lodge, from where it's a short scramble to the summit.</p><h3>Long Trail from Route 4</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 10+ miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,500+ feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 6-8 hours</li></ul><p>A longer approach following the AT/LT from Sherburne Pass. More remote feeling but adds significant distance.</p><h3>Gondola Option</h3><p>During summer and fall, the K-1 Express Gondola runs to near the summit. Hikers can take the gondola up and walk down (or vice versa) for a shorter experience. Check resort schedules and fees.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>Lower Section</h3><p>The trail begins gently, following an old logging road through mixed hardwood forest. Brewers Brook parallels the path, offering pleasant stream sounds. This section is moderate and lulls you into thinking the whole hike will be easy.</p><h3>Upper Section</h3><p>Above 3,000 feet, the trail steepens dramatically. The forest transitions to spruce and fir, and the path becomes rockier. The final approach involves scrambling over exposed rock with excellent views opening up.</p><h3>Cooper Lodge</h3><p>Just below the summit, Cooper Lodge is a stone cabin on the Long Trail that provides emergency shelter. From here, a spur trail leads 0.2 miles to Killington's summit and fire tower.</p><h3>The Summit</h3><p>Killington's summit features a fire tower (open to climb) that provides panoramic views above the trees. On clear days, you can see the White Mountains to the east, Adirondacks to the west, and Green Mountain ridges stretching north and south.</p>"
