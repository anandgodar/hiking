    "introduction": "<p>There's a moment on a winter hike—usually somewhere above treeline, with the world buried under snow and the cold biting at your face—when you realize you're seeing something most people never will. The mountains in winter are quieter, starker, and more beautiful than summer could ever be.</p><p>They're also significantly more dangerous. The White Mountains in winter are genuinely unforgiving terrain. Temperatures can drop to -30°F with wind chill, trails become ice chutes, and rescue is far more complicated when everything is buried under feet of snow.</p><p>I'm not saying this to scare you away. I'm saying it because winter hiking requires a different level of preparation, skill, and respect for the environment. If you're ready to learn, the rewards are incredible.</p>",

Know the route before attempting it in snow.</li><li><strong>Are you comfortable in cold weather?</strong> If a 30°F day feels unbearable, winter hiking will be miserable.</li><li><strong>Can you handle 6+ hours in harsh conditions?</strong> Winter hikes take longer—sometimes twice as long as summer.</li><li><strong>Do you have proper gear?</strong> Cotton kills in winter. You need serious equipment.</li><li><strong>Do you know the signs of hypothermia and frostbite?</strong> In yourself and others?</li></ul><h3>Build Up Gradually</h3><p>Don't start with Mount Washington in January. Start with shorter trails, below-treeline hikes, and work your way up as you learn the skills and acquire the gear.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>Footwear and Traction</h3><ul><li><strong>Insulated winter boots:</strong> Rated to at least -25°F. Regular hiking boots won't cut it.</li><li><strong>Microspikes:</strong> Essential for icy trails. Put them on before you think you need them.</li><li><strong>Snowshoes:</strong> For unbroken trails or deep snow. MSR or Tubbs are popular brands.</li><li><strong>Crampons:</strong> For steep ice. Required for above-treeline terrain in winter.</li><li><strong>Gaiters:</strong> Keep snow out of your boots. Full-length for deep snow.</li></ul><h3>Clothing (Layers!)</h3><ul><li><strong>Base layer:</strong> Merino wool or synthetic. NO COTTON.</li><li><strong>Mid layer:</strong> Fleece or down jacket. Packable puffy for breaks.</li><li><strong>Outer layer:</strong> Waterproof, windproof hard shell (jacket and pants).</li><li><strong>Insulated pants:</strong> Soft shell or insulated hiking pants.</li><li><strong>Hat:</strong> Warm beanie that covers ears. Balaclava for above treeline.</li><li><strong>Gloves:</strong> Two pairs minimum—liner gloves and insulated mittens.</li><li><strong>Extra everything:</strong> Socks, hat, gloves. If something gets wet, you need a backup.</li></ul><h3>Other Essentials</h3><ul><li><strong>Headlamp:</strong> Days are short. Bring extra batteries (cold drains them fast).</li><li><strong>Insulated water bottles:</strong> Regular bottles will freeze. Carry in your pack, not outside pockets.</li><li><strong>High-calorie food:</strong> Your body burns significantly more fuel in cold weather.</li><li><strong>Emergency shelter:</strong> Bivy sack or emergency blanket. Non-negotiable.</li><li><strong>Hand/toe warmers:</strong> For emergencies or cold hands.</li><li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Map, compass, GPS. Trails are harder to follow when buried.</li></ul>"

Know the signs:</p><ul><li>Uncontrollable shivering (early stage)</li><li>Confusion, slurred speech, poor decisions</li><li>Loss of coordination</li><li>Drowsiness</li></ul><p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Stay dry, keep moving, eat and drink regularly, turn around if conditions deteriorate.</p><p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Get out of the cold and wind. Replace wet clothing with dry. Warm the core with body heat, warm drinks, and hand warmers. Seek medical help for severe cases.</p><h3>Frostbite</h3><p>Frozen tissue, usually affecting fingers, toes, ears, and nose.</p><ul><li><strong>Frostnip (early stage):</strong> Pale, waxy skin that feels numb. Rewarm immediately.</li><li><strong>Frostbite:</strong> Hard, frozen tissue. Requires medical attention.</li></ul><p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Proper insulation, regular checks of extremities, keeping moving.</p><h3>Avalanche Awareness</h3><p>Yes, New Hampshire has avalanche terrain. Tuckerman Ravine, Huntington Ravine, and other steep terrain can slide.</p><ul><li>Check the MWAC avalanche forecast before heading out</li><li>Take an avalanche awareness course if you'll be in steep terrain</li><li>Carry rescue gear (beacon, probe, shovel) in avalanche terrain</li></ul><h3>Daylight</h3><p>Winter days are short. In December, you might have only 9 hours of daylight. Plan your hike accordingly, and always carry a headlamp with spare batteries.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>For Beginners (Below Treeline)</h3><ul><li><strong>Lonesome Lake:</strong> Beautiful lake with views, manageable distance, below treeline the whole way.</li><li><strong>Mount Willard:</strong> Great views without above-treeline exposure. Popular and usually well-packed.</li><li><strong>Zealand Falls:</strong> Relatively flat approach to a beautiful AMC hut and frozen waterfall.</li><li><strong>Artist Bluff:</strong> Short and sweet with great views. Good first winter hike.</li></ul><h3>Intermediate (Some Exposure)</h3><ul><li><strong>Mount Eisenhower:</strong> Above treeline summit but shorter than Washington. Great views of the Presidential Range.</li><li><strong>Mount Pierce:</strong> One of the easier 4000-footers in winter. Crawford Path is usually well-traveled.</li><li><strong>Mount Tecumseh:</strong> Shortest route to a 4000-footer summit. Ski area proximity means more traffic.</li></ul><h3>Advanced (Serious Winter Mountaineering)</h3><ul><li><strong>Mount Washington (Lion Head Winter Route):</strong> The classic winter 4000-footer. Requires full mountaineering skills and gear.</li><li><strong>Franconia Ridge:</strong> Stunning but extremely exposed. Serious wind and cold above treeline.</li><li><strong>The Bonds:</strong> Remote, long, and committing. For experienced winter mountaineers only.</li></ul>"

No summit is worth dying for.</li></ul><h3>The Reality Check</h3><p>Winter 4000-footers take roughly 50% longer than summer. A hike that took you 6 hours in July might take 9+ hours in January. The trails are harder to follow, the terrain is more demanding, and you're carrying more weight.</p><p>The exposed summits—Washington, Lafayette, the Bonds—are serious undertakings in winter. Wind speeds regularly exceed hurricane force, visibility can drop to zero, and temperatures can reach -40°F with wind chill.</p><p>Build up to these. Start with the sheltered peaks, develop your winter skills, and work your way up to the big ones.</p>"

        "heading": "Practical Winter Hiking Tips",
        "content": "<ul><li><strong>Layer management:</strong> Start cold. You'll warm up quickly, and sweating leads to hypothermia. Add layers at breaks.</li><li><strong>Keep your water from freezing:</strong> Insulated bottles, carry close to your body, add warm water at the start.</li><li><strong>Eat constantly:</strong> Small snacks every 30-45 minutes. Your body needs fuel to stay warm.</li><li><strong>Don't sit on the snow:</strong> Your body heat will melt it, then you're sitting in water. Bring a foam pad for breaks.</li><li><strong>Protect electronics:</strong> Keep phone and camera batteries warm in your pockets. Cold kills battery life.</li><li><strong>Turn around early:</strong> If conditions are deteriorating or you're not making good time, don't push it. The mountain will be there next weekend.</li></ul>"

    "conclusion": "<h2>Getting Started with Winter Hiking</h2><p>Winter hiking isn't for everyone. It's cold, it's demanding, and it requires significant investment in gear and skills. But for those who embrace it, winter offers a mountain experience unlike any other—quiet trails, stunning ice formations, and a sense of accomplishment that summer hiking can't match.</p><p>Start small. Build your skills. Respect the conditions. And if you're not sure about something, wait for a better day. The mountains aren't going anywhere.</p><p>Stay warm out there.</p>",
