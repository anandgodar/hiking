    "introduction": "<p>Imagine this: You're planning a \"moderate\" 8-mile hike. Your trail app says it's 3,500 feet of elevation gain. You pack accordingly—enough water for a moderate day, plan to be back by 2 PM, and tell your family you'll be home for dinner.</p><p>But halfway up, you realize something's wrong. The trail is steeper than expected. You're exhausted. You check your GPS and discover the actual elevation gain is 5,200 feet—nearly 50% more than advertised. Now you're low on water, behind schedule, and the sun is setting.</p><p>This isn't a hypothetical scenario. It happens regularly. And it's entirely preventable.</p>",

They plan their hikes, pack their gear, and set their expectations based on data from popular hiking apps and websites.

        "content": "<h3>1. User-Generated Content Without Verification</h3><p>Many popular hiking apps rely on crowdsourced data. While community contributions are valuable, they often lack verification:</p><ul><li>Users estimate distances instead of measuring them</li><li>GPS tracks have errors from poor satellite reception</li><li>Elevation data comes from consumer devices (±100 ft error)</li><li>No editorial review or fact-checking process</li></ul><h3>2. Copy-Paste Without Validation</h3><p>Websites copy trail information from each other, propagating errors:</p><ul><li>One site gets Mt. Washington elevation wrong</li><li>50 other sites copy that number</li><li>Now the entire internet has the wrong data</li><li>No one checks against official sources</li></ul><h3>3. Automated GPS Simplification</h3><p>To save file size and bandwidth, GPS paths are often \"simplified\":</p><ul><li>Switchbacks become straight lines</li><li>Detailed trail curves are smoothed out</li><li>Actual trail distance becomes \"as the crow flies\" distance</li><li>Elevation profiles lose important details</li></ul><h3>4. Outdated Information</h3><ul><li>Trail reroutes not updated</li><li>Seasonal closures listed as permanent</li><li>New trail sections not added</li><li>Parking information years out of date</li></ul>"

That's why we've built a verification system that ensures every piece of trail information is traceable to an official source.</p><h3>Our Data Verification Process</h3><h4>Step 1: Official Source Requirement</h4><p>We <strong>never</strong> use data from other hiking websites or apps. Every trail is verified against official sources:</p><ul><li><strong>Tier 1 Sources (Primary):</strong><ul><li>USGS (United States Geological Survey) topographic maps</li><li>NPS (National Park Service) official trail data</li><li>USFS (US Forest Service) trail guides</li><li>State park official websites and maps</li></ul></li><li><strong>Tier 2 Sources (Secondary, Must Verify):</strong><ul><li>Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) guidebooks</li><li>Green Mountain Club official guides</li><li>Adirondack Mountain Club maps</li><li>State conservation agency data</li></ul></li><li><strong>Never Used as Primary Sources:</strong><ul><li>Other hiking apps or websites</li><li>User-generated content without verification</li><li>AI-generated descriptions</li><li>Wikipedia (except to find official sources)</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Step 2: Multi-Source Cross-Referencing</h4><p>We don't trust a single source. For each trail we verify:</p><ul><li>Elevation from USGS benchmark data</li><li>Distance from official trail signage and maps</li><li>GPS coordinates from USGS topographic maps</li><li>Trail conditions from land manager websites</li></ul><h4>Step 3: Documented Verification</h4><p>Every trail on SummitSeeker includes a <code>data_sources</code> field showing exactly where each piece of information came from:</p><pre><code>\"data_sources\": {\n  \"verified_by\": \"National Park Service - Yosemite\",\n  \"primary_url\": \"https://www.nps.gov/yose/...\",\n  \"verification_date\": \"2026-01-18\",\n  \"elevation_source\": \"USGS Benchmark\",\n  \"gps_source\": \"NPS Official Map\",\n  \"distance_source\": \"NPS trail signage\"\n}</code></pre><p>This means:</p><ul><li>You can verify our data yourself</li><li>You know exactly when it was last checked</li><li>You can see the authoritative source</li><li>We're accountable for accuracy</li></ul><h4>Step 4: GPS Path Accuracy</h4><p>We maintain detailed GPS paths with high point density:</p><ul><li><strong>Minimum 15 GPS points per mile</strong> (industry standard is 2-5)</li><li>Switchbacks and trail curves properly represented</li><li>Elevation data at every point</li><li>Actual trail distance, not straight-line distance</li></ul>"

        "heading": "How You Can Verify Trail Data",
        "content": "<p>Whether you use SummitSeeker or other sources, here's how to verify trail information:</p><h3>1. Cross-Reference Multiple Sources</h3><ul><li>Check the land manager's official website</li><li>Look at USGS topographic maps</li><li>Read recent trip reports (last 2-4 weeks)</li><li>Compare data from 2-3 different sources</li></ul><h3>2. Look for Official Sources</h3><p>Prefer data from:</p><ul><li>National Park Service (nps.gov)</li><li>US Forest Service (fs.usda.gov)</li><li>State park agencies</li><li>USGS (usgs.gov)</li></ul><h3>3. Read the Fine Print</h3><p>Check:</p><ul><li>When was the data last updated?</li><li>Where did the data come from?</li><li>Is it verified or user-generated?</li><li>Does the source explain their methodology?</li></ul><h3>4. Calculate Your Own Estimates</h3><p>Use <strong>Naismith's Rule</strong> for hiking time:</p><ul><li>1 hour for every 3 miles</li><li>Plus 1 hour for every 2,000 feet of elevation gain</li><li>Add 20-30% for rough terrain, off-trail, or if you're out of shape</li></ul><p>Example: 10-mile trail with 3,000 ft gain:</p><ul><li>Distance time: 10 miles ÷ 3 = 3.3 hours</li><li>Elevation time: 3,000 ft ÷ 2,000 = 1.5 hours</li><li>Total: ~5 hours, add buffer = <strong>6-7 hours</strong></li></ul><h3>5. Trust But Verify</h3><p>Even with our verified data, you should:</p><ul><li>Check current trail conditions before you go</li><li>Look at weather forecast</li><li>Read recent trip reports</li><li>Verify permit requirements</li><li>Check for seasonal closures</li></ul>"
