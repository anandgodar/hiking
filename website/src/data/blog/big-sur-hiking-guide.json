    "introduction": "<p>Big Sur isn't like other places. For 90 miles along California's central coast, the Santa Lucia Mountains rise directly from the Pacific Ocean, creating a landscape of sheer cliffs, hidden coves, and ancient redwood canyons. It's one of the most scenic stretches of coastline on Earth—and it's threaded with trails that let you experience it on foot.</p><p>Hiking here ranges from short walks to coastal overlooks to strenuous climbs up 5,000-foot peaks. You can wander through redwood groves, descend to secluded beaches, or stand on ridgelines where the mountains meet the sea. Whatever you choose, the scenery is unforgettable.</p>",

        "content": "<h3>Geography</h3><p>Big Sur stretches roughly from Carmel in the north to San Simeon in the south. Highway 1 winds along the coast, providing access to trailheads. The Ventana Wilderness sprawls inland, protecting nearly 250,000 acres of rugged backcountry.</p><h3>Weather</h3><p>Coastal fog is common, especially in summer. Mornings often start gray before burning off by afternoon. The best weather is typically September-November. Winter brings rain—sometimes heavy—which can cause road closures and trail damage.</p><h3>Access Notes</h3><p>Highway 1 is prone to closures from slides and storms. Check conditions before driving. Cell service is limited throughout Big Sur.</p>"
