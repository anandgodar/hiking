    "introduction": "<p>Perched at 3,000 feet in the cliffs above Smugglers' Notch, Sterling Pond is Vermont's highest trout pond—a glacial tarn surrounded by rock walls and evergreen forest. The hike is short but steep, climbing 900 feet in just over a mile. It's a quick route to alpine scenery without an all-day commitment.</p><p>The pond sits in a dramatic bowl between Sterling Mountain and Spruce Peak, with the Long Trail passing right by. It's a popular destination, but for good reason: the setting is spectacular, and there's nothing quite like sitting by a mountain pond after a hearty climb.</p>",

The path wastes no time—it begins climbing immediately through boulder-strewn forest, steep from the first step.</p><p>The trail follows rocky terrain beneath cliff bands, gaining elevation quickly. Wooden steps and stone stairs help navigate the steepest sections. The forest is primarily spruce and fir, adding to the alpine feel even before you reach the pond.</p><p>At about 1.2 miles, the trail levels out as you approach Sterling Pond. The view opens suddenly: the dark pond surrounded by cliffs and forest, with Spruce Peak rising beyond.</p>"
