    "introduction": "<p>Not every hike needs to be an epic. Sometimes you want a quick escape from the city—a trail that offers real views without demanding hours of effort. Bradbury Mountain delivers exactly that: a 485-foot summit just 20 minutes from Portland, with trails short enough for young children but rewarding enough for anyone seeking a quick nature fix.</p><p>From the open summit, views stretch to Casco Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. On clear days, you can see Mount Washington in New Hampshire. And the trail network offers options for extended exploration if you want more than the quick summit loop.</p>",

Starting from the main parking area, the well-maintained path climbs through mixed forest before emerging onto the open granite summit. The grade is gentle throughout, with a few slightly steeper sections near the top.</p><p>This is an excellent trail for young hikers (ages 3+), dogs on leash, and anyone looking for a quick outdoor escape.</p>"
