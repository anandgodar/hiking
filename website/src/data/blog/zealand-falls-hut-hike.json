    "introduction": "<p>The Appalachian Mountain Club's hut system is one of the treasures of the White Mountains—eight backcountry lodges where hikers can get a hot meal, a bunk bed, and camaraderie with fellow mountain lovers. For many people, Zealand Falls Hut is where this tradition begins.</p><p>At just 2.8 miles from the trailhead on a relatively gentle trail, Zealand is the most accessible of the AMC huts. It's where families bring kids on their first overnight hiking trip, where beginners get hooked on the hut system, and where experienced hikers go when they want mountain magic without the punishment.</p>",

        "content": "<h3>Zealand Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.8 miles one way</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 650 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</li></ul><p>The trail follows an old railroad grade for most of its length, meaning it's wide, well-graded, and gentle. You'll cross several streams on bridges, pass through pleasant birch forests, and gradually climb toward the hut. The final 0.3 miles steepen slightly as you approach Zealand Falls, but nothing here would qualify as strenuous.</p><p>For families with young children, this trail is ideal. Kids as young as 4 or 5 regularly make the hike, though it may take longer than the usual 1.5-2 hours.</p>"

The setting is spectacular—you can sit on the rocks beside the hut and watch the water cascade down while mountains rise in every direction.</p><p>What you'll find at the hut:</p><ul><li><strong>Bunks:</strong> Co-ed bunkrooms with mattresses and pillows (bring your own sleeping bag or rent a liner)</li><li><strong>Meals:</strong> Dinner and breakfast included with overnight stays; lunch items available for purchase</li><li><strong>Crew:</strong> College-age staffers who pack in supplies, cook meals, and share their love of the mountains</li><li><strong>Library:</strong> Books, games, and puzzles for evening entertainment</li><li><strong>Composting toilets:</strong> Modern facilities—not outhouses</li></ul><p>The social atmosphere is part of the appeal. You'll share long tables at dinner, swap trail stories with strangers, and possibly make friends you'll hike with for years.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>Reservations</h3><p>AMC huts book early, especially for summer weekends and fall foliage. Make reservations at outdoors.org as far in advance as possible. Weeknights are easier to book than weekends.</p><h3>Costs</h3><p>Expect to pay around $150-170 per adult for an overnight stay including dinner and breakfast. AMC members receive a discount. It's not cheap, but you're paying for the location, the meals, and the unique experience.</p><h3>What to Bring</h3><ul><li>Sleeping bag or liner (can rent at hut)</li><li>Headlamp</li><li>Change of clothes</li><li>Snacks for the trail</li><li>Water bottle (hut has treated water)</li><li>Earplugs (bunkrooms can be noisy)</li></ul><h3>Day Visit Option</h3><p>You don't need a reservation to visit Zealand Falls during the day. Hike in, buy lunch at the hut, enjoy the falls, and hike out. It's a great way to experience AMC hut culture without committing to an overnight.</p>"
