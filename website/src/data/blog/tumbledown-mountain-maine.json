    "introduction": "<p>Picture this: you've hiked through forest and scrambled up rocks, your legs are tired and you're ready for a reward—and then you crest a ridge to find a pristine alpine pond cupped in a rocky bowl, deep blue water surrounded by granite cliffs, with the Maine wilderness stretching to every horizon.</p><p>That's Tumbledown Mountain. It's one of Maine's most beloved hikes, and the reason is simple: that pond. Tumbledown Pond sits just below the summit at 2,800 feet, crystal clear and cold enough to take your breath away. In summer, hikers strip down and dive in, cooling off before the final push to the summit. It's the kind of scene that makes you feel like you've discovered something magical.</p><p>You haven't, of course—Tumbledown is popular, especially on summer weekends. But that popularity exists because this place delivers something special.</p>",

        "heading": "Trail Options",
        "content": "<p>There are four main routes up Tumbledown, ranging from moderate to challenging. All lead to the pond; choose based on your appetite for adventure.</p><h3>Brook Trail (Most Popular)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 4.8 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,600 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 3-4 hours</li></ul><p>The easiest route to the pond, following a stream through mixed forest before climbing more steeply to the cirque. This is the family-friendly option, though 'easy' is relative—there's still real climbing involved.</p><h3>Loop Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 5.5 miles</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,800 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate-Strenuous</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 4-5 hours</li></ul><p>A combination of Brook Trail up and Parker Ridge Trail down (or vice versa). This is my recommended option—you get varied terrain and avoid repeating steps.</p><h3>Parker Ridge Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 3.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,600 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 3-4 hours</li></ul><p>Shorter but steeper, with open ledges that offer views early. Good choice if you want efficiency and don't mind a workout.</p><h3>Tumbledown Ridge Trail (Fat Man's Misery)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.5 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,300 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Very Strenuous</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 2.5-3.5 hours</li></ul><p>The adventure route. This trail involves significant scrambling, ladder rungs, and a squeeze through a narrow crack in the rock called 'Fat Man's Misery.' It's short but intense—essentially a via ferrata experience without the cables. Not for beginners or those uncomfortable with exposure.</p>"

        "heading": "The Pond and Summit",
        "content": "<h3>Tumbledown Pond</h3><p>All trails converge at the pond, which sits in a dramatic rocky cirque. The water is deep, clear, and cold—even in August, expect temperatures around 60°F. But on a hot day after a sweaty climb, it's absolute perfection.</p><p>A few tips:</p><ul><li>Bring a towel and change of clothes if you plan to swim</li><li>The pond bottom drops off quickly—only confident swimmers should go deep</li><li>Leave no trace applies here too—no soap, no sunscreen in the water</li><li>There are nice rock slabs for sunning and picnicking</li></ul><h3>The Summit</h3><p>From the pond, a short scramble leads to Tumbledown's west peak (3,068 feet). The views are excellent—Lake Webb and Webb Lake glitter to the south, and the surrounding mountains roll away in every direction. Most hikers don't bother with the slightly higher east peak, but completists can tag it via a connecting ridge trail.</p>"

        "heading": "Getting There",
        "content": "<h3>Directions</h3><p>Tumbledown is located off Route 142 in Weld, about 40 minutes from Farmington. The trailhead parking area is well-signed but fills up quickly on summer weekends.</p><h3>Parking</h3><ul><li>The main lot holds about 30 cars</li><li>Arrive before 9 AM on summer Saturdays or expect to park on the road</li><li>No fee, but donations appreciated for trail maintenance</li></ul><h3>Alternative Starting Points</h3><p>The Tumbledown Ridge Trail starts from a different lot on Byron Road. This is the access point for Fat Man's Misery.</p>"

      {
        "heading": "Best Time to Visit",
        "content": "<h3>Summer (June-August)</h3><p>Prime time for the pond. Water temps are 'tolerable' for swimming, days are long, and the ledges are warm for sunning. Also the most crowded—weekdays are significantly quieter.</p><h3>Fall (September-October)</h3><p>Fall colors are spectacular from the summit. Swimming is bracing at best, hypothermic at worst, but the hiking is excellent with smaller crowds and crisp air.</p><h3>Spring (April-May)</h3><p>Muddy, buggy, and the pond is frigid. Not recommended unless you're specifically seeking solitude.</p><h3>Winter</h3><p>Tumbledown sees winter use, but the steep trails can be treacherous. Experienced winter hikers only, with full traction and ice axe.</p>"

      {
        "heading": "Make It a Loop",
        "content": "<p>The best Tumbledown experience combines two trails into a loop. Here's my recommendation:</p><h3>The Classic Loop (Counterclockwise)</h3><ol><li>Start on Brook Trail—easier climbing to warm up</li><li>Reach the pond, take a swim, have lunch</li><li>Scramble to the summit for views</li><li>Descend via Parker Ridge Trail for different scenery</li></ol><p>This gives you the gentler climb up and the steeper (but manageable) descent down.</p><h3>The Adventure Loop</h3><ol><li>Start on Tumbledown Ridge Trail (Fat Man's Misery)</li><li>Get the technical scrambling done early when you're fresh</li><li>Enjoy the pond and summit</li><li>Descend via Brook Trail, the easiest option for tired legs</li></ol><p>Only attempt this if you're comfortable with exposure and scrambling.</p>"

Located in Mount Blue State Park nearby.</p><h3>Bald Mountain (Weld)</h3><p>A shorter, easier hike with good views of Lake Webb. Perfect if Tumbledown sounds like too much.</p><h3>Webb Lake</h3><p>After your hike, cool off properly at the public beach on Webb Lake in Weld. Ice cream is available in town.</p>"
