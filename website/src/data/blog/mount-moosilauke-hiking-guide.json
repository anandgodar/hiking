    "introduction": "<p>Mount Moosilauke is what a mountain should look like. Rising alone at the western edge of the White Mountains, its massive bald summit dome is visible for miles in every direction. Native Americans called it \"bald place\"—an apt description for a peak where the treeline drops away long before the summit, leaving hikers in a landscape of rock, alpine vegetation, and endless sky.</p><p>At 4,802 feet, Moosilauke is the tenth-highest peak in New Hampshire and the westernmost 4,000-footer. It's also the first significant mountain northbound Appalachian Trail thru-hikers encounter—a welcome sign that the trail is about to get serious. For everyone else, it's simply one of the best hikes in New England.</p>",

        "content": "<h3>Gorge Brook Trail (Most Popular)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 7.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,450 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>Starting from the Dartmouth Outing Club's Ravine Lodge, this is the classic Moosilauke route. The trail climbs steadily through hardwood forest, crosses Gorge Brook several times, and eventually emerges above treeline for the final push to the summit. The grade is consistent and reasonable—challenging enough to feel like an accomplishment, but accessible to fit hikers of all experience levels.</p><h3>Beaver Brook Trail (Appalachian Trail)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 6.8 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 3,100 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>The AT route up Moosilauke is no joke. The trail descends (or ascends, depending on your direction) steep rock slabs with wooden steps and handrails. It's famous as one of the most challenging sections of the entire AT, particularly difficult when wet. Beautiful waterfalls and cascades line the route, but this is not a beginner trail.</p><h3>Carriage Road</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 8.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,400 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate (but longer)</li></ul><p>An old carriage road that provides the gentlest grade to the summit. Good for those who prefer steady climbing without technical terrain. Can be combined with Gorge Brook for a loop.</p>"

        "heading": "The Summit Experience",
        "content": "<p>Moosilauke's summit is what sets it apart. The alpine zone begins well below the top, giving you nearly a mile of above-treeline hiking. On a clear day, you can see Mount Washington and the Presidential Range to the northeast, the Green Mountains of Vermont to the west, and on exceptional days, the Adirondacks across Lake Champlain.</p><p>The summit once held a hotel—the Summit House, which operated from 1860 to 1942. Today, only foundation ruins remain, but they hint at the mountain's long history as a destination. The Dartmouth Outing Club maintains the trails and operates the Ravine Lodge at the trailhead.</p><p>What makes Moosilauke special:</p><ul><li><strong>Alpine exposure:</strong> More above-treeline hiking than most New England peaks</li><li><strong>360-degree views:</strong> No obstructions in any direction</li><li><strong>Solitude:</strong> Less crowded than the Franconia Ridge or Presidentials</li><li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Moderate trails make alpine terrain achievable for intermediates</li></ul>"

        "heading": "When to Hike",
        "content": "<p>Moosilauke is hikeable three seasons but demands respect year-round:</p><ul><li><strong>Late May through October:</strong> Prime hiking season. Snow can linger on the summit into June; mud season affects lower trails in spring.</li><li><strong>Fall:</strong> Spectacular foliage views, especially from the alpine zone looking down at the colorful forests.</li><li><strong>Winter:</strong> A serious undertaking. The exposed summit is extremely cold and windy. Full winter gear and experience required.</li></ul><h3>Weather Considerations</h3><p>That massive bald summit has no place to hide if weather turns. Bring extra layers even in summer—the summit can be 20-30 degrees colder than the trailhead with significant wind. Check forecasts for Mount Washington; conditions on Moosilauke are often similar.</p>"

        "heading": "Practical Information",
        "content": "<h3>Trailhead Access</h3><p>Most hikers use the Gorge Brook Trailhead at Dartmouth's Ravine Lodge, reached via a winding road from Route 118. Parking fills on summer weekends—arrive early or consider weekdays.</p><h3>Ravine Lodge</h3><p>The Dartmouth Outing Club's Ravine Lodge offers rustic accommodations and meals during the hiking season. It's a wonderful way to extend your Moosilauke experience—arrive the evening before, enjoy a home-cooked breakfast, and hit the trail early.</p><h3>Dogs</h3><p>Dogs are allowed but must be leashed. The Beaver Brook Trail's steep rock slabs are challenging for many dogs.</p><h3>Leave No Trace</h3><p>The alpine summit is fragile. Stay on marked trails and bare rock; don't walk on vegetation. These plants take decades to recover from trampling.</p>"
