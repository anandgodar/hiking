    "introduction": "<p>Smugglers Notch is Vermont's most dramatic mountain pass—a narrow gap between Mount Mansfield and Spruce Peak where 1,000-foot cliffs tower above a road so steep and winding it closes each winter. Named for the smugglers who used it to evade trade embargoes in the early 1800s, the notch today draws hikers to some of Vermont's finest trails.</p><p>From the notch parking area, you can access Vermont's highest peak, glacial Sterling Pond, mysterious boulder caves, and cliff-face scrambles—all within a few miles. It's a concentration of hiking opportunities unmatched elsewhere in the state.</p>",

The pond reflects the surrounding peaks on calm days and offers excellent swimming (cold!) in summer. Sterling Pond Shelter provides backcountry camping.</p><h3>Hell Brook Trail to Mount Mansfield</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 3.2 miles round trip to the Chin</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,800 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Very Strenuous</li></ul><p>The most challenging route to Mansfield's summit, Hell Brook is steep, rough, and utterly relentless. Expect rock scrambling, wooden ladders, and constant upward movement. It's the shortest route to Vermont's highest point but demands experience and fitness.</p><h3>Long Trail South (Elephant's Head)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 800 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>A worthwhile spur leads to Elephant's Head, a cliff-top overlook with spectacular views down into the notch. Less traveled than other options and perfect for an afternoon adventure.</p>"

        "heading": "Boulder Caves",
        "content": "<p>Giant boulders tumbled from the cliffs above have created a labyrinth of caves and passages at the base of the notch. These aren't true caves but spaces between massive rocks—some requiring hands-and-knees crawling, others tall enough to walk through.</p><p>The caves are unmarked but located near the notch parking area. Look for informal paths leading into the boulder fields. Some highlights:</p><ul><li><strong>Smuggler's Cave:</strong> The largest and most visited</li><li><strong>Various passages:</strong> Explore at your own risk; some are tight</li></ul><p>A flashlight is essential. The caves can be wet and cold even in summer. Children love them, but supervision is critical—it's easy to get disoriented among the boulders.</p>"

Note: the road is closed November through May due to extreme winter conditions.</p><h3>Parking</h3><p>The notch parking area is small and fills early on summer weekends. Arrive before 8 AM or consider hiking in from Stowe Mountain Resort via the Long Trail.</p><h3>Best Times</h3><ul><li><strong>Late May through October:</strong> Road is open; full trail access</li><li><strong>Fall foliage:</strong> Spectacular but crowded</li><li><strong>Winter:</strong> Road closed; backcountry ski access only</li></ul>"
