    "introduction": "<p>Lake Tahoe might be the most beautiful body of water in North America. The statistics are impressive—22 miles long, 12 miles wide, 1,645 feet deep, with clarity that lets you see 70+ feet down. But statistics don't capture it. The first time you see Tahoe's impossible blue, ringed by granite peaks and pine forest, you understand why it draws millions of visitors.</p><p>For hikers, Tahoe is paradise. The 165-mile Tahoe Rim Trail circles the entire lake, mostly on ridgelines with constant water views. Desolation Wilderness offers backcountry adventure just minutes from the shore. And dozens of shorter trails lead to hidden lakes, panoramic viewpoints, and quiet beaches.</p><p>Whether you want a gentle lakeside stroll or a strenuous climb to Sierra summits, Tahoe has a trail for you.</p>",

Some shuttle services operate in summer.</p><h3>Altitude Adjustment</h3><p>At 6,200+ feet (trailheads), visitors from sea level should take it easy the first day.
