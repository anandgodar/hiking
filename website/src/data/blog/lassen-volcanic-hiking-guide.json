    "introduction": "<p>Lassen Volcanic National Park is California's forgotten national park—overshadowed by Yosemite and tucked away in the northern reaches of the state, it sees a fraction of the visitors despite extraordinary volcanic landscapes. Lassen Peak last erupted in 1915, making this one of the few places in the contiguous US where you can hike through an active volcanic landscape.</p><p>The park contains all four types of volcanoes found in the world (plug dome, shield, cinder cone, and stratovolcano), plus hydrothermal areas with boiling springs, mud pots, and fumaroles. It's part science exhibit, part wilderness adventure, and entirely underrated.</p>",

        "content": "<h3>Lassen Peak Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 5.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,000 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>The signature hike—climbing to the summit of the largest plug dome volcano in the world at 10,457 feet. The trail switchbacks up the volcanic slopes, passing through alpine terrain to a summit with views stretching to Mount Shasta and the distant Sierra Nevada. The thin air at elevation adds to the challenge.</p><h3>Bumpass Hell Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 3.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 300 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>The park's largest hydrothermal area, accessed by boardwalks through a landscape of bubbling mud pots, hissing fumaroles, and boiling springs. The colors—yellows, oranges, and turquoise pools—are otherworldly. Named for explorer Kendall Bumpass, who severely burned his leg breaking through the thin crust here in 1865. Stay on the boardwalk.</p><h3>Cinder Cone Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 4.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 850 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate-Strenuous</li></ul><p>Climb a nearly perfect volcanic cinder cone that erupted in the 1650s. The trail crosses the Fantastic Lava Beds before ascending the steep, loose cinder slopes. The summit crater rim offers views of the Painted Dunes below—volcanic ash in shades of red and orange.</p><h3>Kings Creek Falls</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 3.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 400 feet (plus return climb)</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>A forest trail leading to one of the park's most beautiful waterfalls. The creek cascades 50 feet over a volcanic ledge. The descent is easy; the return climb is steady but not difficult.</p>"

The trail climbs through meadows and forest to a 9,235-foot summit with panoramic views.</p><h3>Manzanita Lake Loop</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 1.6 miles loop</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</li></ul><p>A gentle lakeshore trail with views of Lassen Peak reflected in the calm waters. Perfect for early morning photography or a relaxed family walk.</p><h3>Terrace, Shadow, and Cliff Lakes</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 3.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 700 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>A scenic trail passing three beautiful alpine lakes in varied settings. Good for swimming in late summer.</p>"

The main park road (Highway 89) traverses the park and provides access to major trailheads.</p><h3>Fees and Facilities</h3><ul><li>Entrance fee: $30/vehicle for 7 days</li><li>Camping available at several campgrounds</li><li>Limited services—fuel and supplies available in nearby towns</li></ul><h3>Safety Notes</h3><ul><li>Stay on established trails in hydrothermal areas—ground can be unstable</li><li>Altitude sickness possible on Lassen Peak trail</li><li>Weather changes rapidly at elevation; bring layers</li><li>Snow can persist on trails into July</li></ul>"

    "conclusion": "<h2>Quick Reference: Lassen Volcanic Hikes</h2><table><tr><th>Trail</th><th>Distance</th><th>Difficulty</th><th>Best For</th></tr><tr><td>Lassen Peak</td><td>5.0 mi</td><td>Strenuous</td><td>Summit views</td></tr><tr><td>Bumpass Hell</td><td>3.0 mi</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Hydrothermal</td></tr><tr><td>Cinder Cone</td><td>4.0 mi</td><td>Mod-Stren</td><td>Volcanic geology</td></tr><tr><td>Kings Creek Falls</td><td>3.0 mi</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Waterfall</td></tr></table><p>Lassen Volcanic National Park offers something genuinely different—hiking through landscapes shaped by recent volcanic activity, with features you won't find elsewhere in the California park system. The smaller crowds make it even better. If you've done the state's famous parks and want something new, head north to Lassen and discover California's most underappreciated natural wonder.</p>",
