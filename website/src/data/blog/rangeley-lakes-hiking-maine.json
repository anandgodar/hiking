    "introduction": "<p>The Rangeley Lakes region feels like Maine's secret wilderness. Tucked into the western mountains near the New Hampshire border, this lake-studded landscape offers hiking that rivals anything in the state—without the crowds of Acadia or the regulations of Baxter.</p><p>The Appalachian Trail passes through here, crossing several 4,000-foot peaks including Saddleback Mountain and the Horn. Smaller peaks offer easier objectives with excellent lake views. And the region's remoteness means you'll often have trails to yourself, even on summer weekends.</p>",
