    "introduction": "<p>Not every great Adirondack hike requires an all-day death march. Ampersand Mountain proves that point beautifully: at just 5.4 miles round trip with 1,800 feet of gain, it's accessible to most fit hikers. Yet the summit—a broad dome of bare granite with 360-degree views—rivals any High Peak for scenery.</p><p>Ampersand isn't one of the 46 High Peaks (it falls just short at 3,353 feet), but that technicality works in your favor. The crowds are smaller, the trail is well-maintained, and the experience is pure Adirondack magic without the suffering.</p>",

Enjoy this section—it's the only flat part. Soon the trail leaves the brook and begins climbing, moderately at first, then more steeply as you approach the summit.</p><p>The final section is the steepest, with rock stairs and some scrambling required. But it's never technical, and the emerging views provide motivation.</p>"
