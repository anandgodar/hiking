    "introduction": "<p>Point Reyes juts into the Pacific like a geological afterthought—a fragment of land slowly drifting north along the San Andreas Fault. This isolation has created something special: 71,000 acres of wilderness just 30 miles from the Golden Gate Bridge, home to elk herds, migrating whales, and over 150 miles of trails.</p><p>The hiking here is remarkably varied. You can walk through bishop pine forests, climb to coastal ridges, descend to empty beaches, or stand on cliffs watching for whales. The landscape feels wilder than its proximity to San Francisco would suggest—a reminder that California's coast still holds places where nature runs the show.</p>",

        "content": "<h3>Tomales Point Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 9.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 800 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>Walk through the tule elk reserve on this spectacular coastal trail. The path follows the ridgeline north, with views of Tomales Bay on one side and the Pacific on the other. Elk are commonly spotted grazing the grasslands. Continue to the very tip for dramatic cliff views.</p><h3>Alamere Falls</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 8.5 miles round trip (from Palomarin)</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,000 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>A tidefall—one of only two in California where a waterfall drops directly onto a beach. The hike passes Bass Lake and beautiful coastal terrain. Note: The falls require a short, steep scramble to access safely. Check tide tables and never climb the cliffs.</p><h3>Bear Valley to Arch Rock</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 8.2 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 600 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy-Moderate</li></ul><p>A classic Point Reyes hike through mixed forest to a dramatic coastal overlook. The trail is well-graded and popular. At Arch Rock, sea stacks and offshore rocks frame the Pacific vista.</p><h3>Chimney Rock Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 1.8 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 200 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</li></ul><p>A short walk to excellent whale-watching territory. During winter gray whale migration (January-April), this is one of the best viewing spots on the coast. Harbor seals also frequent the beaches below.</p>"

The stairs are the challenge—coming back up tests your legs. Views of the coast and (in season) migrating whales make it worthwhile.</p><h3>Estero Trail to Sunset Beach</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 8.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 400 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>Traverse coastal grasslands to a beautiful secluded beach on Drake's Estero. Good for birding and quiet contemplation.</p><h3>Sky Trail to Mount Wittenberg</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 4.5 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,300 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate-Strenuous</li></ul><p>Climb to Point Reyes' highest point (1,407 feet) for panoramic views of the peninsula, Drake's Bay, and the Farallon Islands on clear days.</p>"

The elk are wild—keep at least 75 feet away and never approach.</p><h3>Whales</h3><p>Gray whales migrate past Point Reyes from December through April, heading to and from Mexican breeding grounds. Chimney Rock and the Lighthouse are prime viewing spots.</p><h3>Elephant Seals</h3><p>A growing colony of elephant seals inhabits beaches in the Drake's Beach area. Winter and spring offer the most activity as seals breed and birth pups.</p><h3>Birds</h3><p>Over 490 bird species have been recorded at Point Reyes—one of the highest counts in North America. Bring binoculars.</p>"
