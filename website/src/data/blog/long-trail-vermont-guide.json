    "introduction": "<p>Before the Appalachian Trail, before the Pacific Crest Trail, there was the Long Trail. Completed in 1930, this 272-mile footpath runs the length of Vermont, following the main ridge of the Green Mountains from Massachusetts to Canada. It's the oldest long-distance hiking trail in America—and still one of the finest.</p><p>The Long Trail traverses every major peak in Vermont, including all five summits over 4,000 feet. It passes through dense hardwood forests, across alpine ridges, past mountain ponds, and over rocky summits with views stretching to New York, New Hampshire, and Quebec. Along the way, a system of 70+ shelters provides backcountry lodging in the classic Northeastern style.</p><p>Whether you're planning a thru-hike, a section hike, or just a day trip, the Long Trail offers quintessential Vermont mountain hiking.</p>",

South of Route 4 (Killington), it coincides with the Appalachian Trail. North of there, the AT splits east toward New Hampshire while the LT continues north through Vermont's most remote terrain.</p><h3>Managing Organization</h3><p>The Green Mountain Club (GMC) maintains the Long Trail, its shelters, and the extensive side trail network. They publish the authoritative guidebook and maps, operate a visitor center in Waterbury, and organize volunteer trail crews.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>Time Required</h3><p>Most thru-hikers complete the trail in 18-25 days, averaging 12-15 miles per day. Faster hikers can finish in 14 days; more relaxed paces take 30+.</p><h3>Direction</h3><p>Most hikers go south to north (SOBO), starting at the Massachusetts border. This puts the hardest terrain (Mansfield, the Monroe Skyline) near the end when you're in peak shape. Going NOBO (north to south) works too and offers a dramatic early finish at the Canadian border.</p><h3>Ideal Season</h3><p>Late June through early October. Earlier, expect mud and snow at elevation. Later, expect cold temps and early season snowstorms. July and August offer the best weather but also the most crowded shelters.</p><h3>Resupply</h3><p>Major resupply points:</p><ul><li>Bennington (near southern terminus)</li><li>Manchester Center (Route 11/30)</li><li>Killington/Rutland (Route 4)</li><li>Warren/Waitsfield (Appalachian Gap)</li><li>Waterbury/Stowe (Route 2)</li><li>Johnson (Route 15)</li></ul><p>Mailing packages to post offices or hostels is common. Some hostels offer shuttle services.</p>"
