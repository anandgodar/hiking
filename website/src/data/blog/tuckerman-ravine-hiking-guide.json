    "introduction": "<p>Of all the routes to Mount Washington's 6,288-foot summit, Tuckerman Ravine Trail is the most iconic. Named for botanist Edward Tuckerman, who explored the area in the 1830s, this path takes hikers into one of the most dramatic glacial cirques in the eastern United States before climbing the headwall to the summit.</p><p>The \"Tucks\" experience is legendary. You'll pass rushing cascades, ascend through dense spruce forest, emerge into the massive ravine bowl, and finally tackle the steep climb to the summit ridge. It's challenging—4.2 miles and 4,250 feet of elevation gain—but for many hikers, it's the only way to truly summit Mount Washington.</p>",

        "content": "<h3>Trail Overview</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 8.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 4,250 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>The trail begins at Pinkham Notch Visitor Center, where the AMC has a lodge, store, and plenty of information. The first 2.4 miles climb steadily but moderately through forest, passing Crystal Cascade early on—a beautiful 80-foot waterfall worth a brief stop.</p><p>At Hermit Lake, you'll find the Hermit Lake Shelters (reservations required for overnight stays) and get your first glimpse of the massive ravine headwall above. From here, the trail steepens significantly as it enters the ravine.</p><p>The final push from the ravine floor to the summit is the crux. You'll gain 1,400 feet in less than a mile, scrambling over boulders in the famous \"Little Headwall\" section before reaching the summit cone. The terrain here is exposed and serious—not a place to be caught in bad weather.</p>"

        "heading": "What Makes Tuckerman Special",
        "content": "<p>Tuckerman Ravine is a textbook glacial cirque—a bowl carved by ancient ice into the mountain's east face. The walls rise 800 feet on three sides, creating a natural amphitheater that holds snow well into summer. This lingering snow is why Tuckerman is famous among backcountry skiers, who climb the ravine to ski its steep slopes in spring.</p><p>For hikers, the appeal is different:</p><ul><li><strong>Scenic drama:</strong> The ravine itself is visually stunning—a massive bowl carved from the mountainside</li><li><strong>Above-treeline terrain:</strong> Miles of alpine hiking above 4,000 feet</li><li><strong>Summit access:</strong> Arrive at the highest point in the Northeast, where the weather observatory, Sherman Adams building, and Cog Railway terminus await</li><li><strong>Sense of accomplishment:</strong> This isn't a walk in the park—you earn every step</li></ul>"

It diverges from the Tuckerman Ravine Trail and takes a ridge to the summit, avoiding the ravine's hazards.</p><h3>One-Way Options</h3><p>Many hikers ascend via Tuckerman and descend by another route:</p><ul><li><strong>Boot Spur Trail:</strong> Descend via a scenic ridge to the south</li><li><strong>Auto Road:</strong> In summer, you can arrange for a shuttle van to pick you up at the summit</li><li><strong>Cog Railway:</strong> Purchase a one-way ticket down (expensive but memorable)</li></ul><h3>Overnight at Hermit Lake</h3><p>The Hermit Lake Shelters provide a unique opportunity to split the climb over two days.
