    "introduction": "<p>San Jacinto Peak rises 10,834 feet above the Coachella Valley floor, creating one of the most dramatic vertical escarpments in North America. The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway makes this Alpine summit accessible by whisking hikers from desert heat to pine forest in under 15 minutes. From the tram station at 8,516 feet, trails lead to a summit with views that stretch for 200 miles on clear days.</p><p>The experience is almost surreal: you can wake up in the desert, ride a rotating tram car up sheer cliffs, hike through snow-dusted conifers, and summit a genuinely impressive peak—all before lunch.</p>",
