    "introduction": "<p>Standing at 5,269 feet, Katahdin isn't just Maine's highest mountain—it's a symbol. For Appalachian Trail thru-hikers, it represents the end of a 2,190-mile journey from Georgia. For New Englanders, it's the crown jewel of our region's peaks. For everyone who climbs it, it's an unforgettable experience.</p><p>Katahdin sits in Baxter State Park, a 200,000-acre wilderness preserve with strict regulations designed to protect its wild character. There are no cell towers, no gift shops, and no easy routes. The mountain demands respect—and rewards those who come prepared.</p><p>I've climbed Katahdin via multiple routes over the years, in different seasons and conditions. It never gets old. Here's what you need to know to plan your trip.</p>",

Every route to the summit involves significant elevation gain over rocky, often steep terrain. The mountain is above treeline for the final stretch, exposing you to weather that can change rapidly.</p><p>Baxter State Park has strict regulations that limit access. You need reservations for parking, the park gates open and close at specific times, and rangers will turn away hikers who aren't properly equipped.</p>"

        "heading": "Routes to the Summit",
        "content": "<h3>Hunt Trail (Appalachian Trail)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 10.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 4,188 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>The classic AT route and the most popular way up Katahdin. You'll start at Katahdin Stream Campground, pass beautiful waterfalls, climb through forest, then emerge onto the famous Tablelands—a massive alpine plateau unlike anything else in the Northeast.</p><p>This is the route most AT thru-hikers use for their finish. If you're lucky, you might witness an emotional summit celebration.</p><h3>Knife Edge</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 1.1 miles (traverse only)</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Very Strenuous / Exposed</li></ul><p>The Knife Edge isn't a complete route—it's a legendary traverse across a narrow, exposed ridge connecting Pamola Peak to Baxter Peak. With drops of hundreds of feet on both sides and sections where the ridge is only a few feet wide, it's one of the most thrilling trail miles in the East.</p><p><strong>The classic Knife Edge loop:</strong> Helon Taylor Trail up → Knife Edge to Baxter Peak → Hunt Trail down (11+ miles total)</p><p><strong>Is the Knife Edge for you?</strong> If you have any fear of heights, exposure, or drops, skip it. The consequences of a fall here are severe. But if you're comfortable on exposed terrain, it's an unforgettable experience.</p><h3>Saddle Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 8.2 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 4,000 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Very Strenuous</li></ul><p>The shortest route to the summit but also the steepest. The Saddle Trail includes the infamous \"boulder field\"—a steep section of giant boulders that requires hands-on scrambling. Faster than Hunt Trail but more demanding.</p><h3>Abol Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 7.6 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 4,000 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Very Strenuous</li></ul><p>The shortest route but also the most brutal. The Abol Slide is a relentless grind up loose rock. I don't recommend this route unless you specifically want a challenge—other trails are more scenic for similar effort.</p>"

        "heading": "Planning Your Trip: The Reservation System",
        "content": "<h3>You Need Reservations</h3><p>Baxter State Park limits access to protect the wilderness. You'll need:</p><ul><li><strong>Day-use parking reservation:</strong> Required for all trailheads. Released 4 months in advance.</li><li><strong>Camping reservation:</strong> If you want to stay in the park. Also books up months ahead.</li></ul><p>Popular dates (summer weekends, peak foliage) sell out within minutes of becoming available. Plan early and be online exactly when reservations open if you want a prime slot.</p><h3>Park Regulations</h3><ul><li><strong>Gates open:</strong> Typically 6 AM (varies by season)</li><li><strong>Gates close:</strong> Rangers may close the road if the day-use quota is reached</li><li><strong>No pets:</strong> Dogs are not allowed on any trails</li><li><strong>No RVs:</strong> Vehicle length restrictions apply</li><li><strong>Hiker readiness:</strong> Rangers assess hikers and can turn away those deemed unprepared</li></ul><h3>Getting There</h3><p>Baxter State Park is remote—about 3.5 hours from Portland, 4.5 hours from Boston. The nearest town is Millinocket, where you'll find motels, restaurants, and gear stores.</p><p>Fill up on gas before entering the park. There are no services inside.</p>"

The trails typically open in late May or early June depending on snowmelt, and conditions remain good through September.</p><ul><li><strong>July-August:</strong> Most reliable weather, longest days, busiest trails</li><li><strong>September:</strong> Fewer crowds, crisp weather, early fall colors</li><li><strong>October:</strong> Peak foliage, cooling temperatures, shorter days</li></ul><h3>Weather Considerations</h3><p>Katahdin creates its own weather. Even on a clear day in Millinocket, the summit can be socked in with clouds, wind, and cold. Check the forecast carefully, but know that conditions can change rapidly.</p><p>The Tablelands are fully exposed—no shelter from wind, rain, or lightning. If weather moves in, get below treeline quickly.</p><h3>What Not to Do</h3><p>Don't attempt Katahdin in winter unless you're an experienced mountaineer with proper equipment. The park restricts winter access, and conditions can be genuinely life-threatening.</p>"

Weather can change fast.</li><li><strong>Warm layers:</strong> Fleece, wind layer, hat, gloves. The summit can be 20+ degrees colder than the trailhead.</li><li><strong>Plenty of food:</strong> This is a long day. Bring more than you think you need.</li><li><strong>Headlamp:</strong> Even with an early start, you might be out longer than planned.</li><li><strong>Map and compass:</strong> The Tablelands can be disorienting in fog.</li><li><strong>First aid kit:</strong> Including blister care—your feet will work hard.</li></ul><p><strong>Baxter rangers may check your gear.</strong> If you don't have essentials, you may be turned away.

Don't burn out in the first hour.</li><li><strong>Eat and drink regularly.</strong> Don't wait until you feel hungry or thirsty.</li><li><strong>Take breaks in sheltered spots.</strong> Above treeline, the wind can be brutal.</li><li><strong>Sign the summit register.</strong> It's a tradition. Bring a pen.</li><li><strong>Watch your footing on descent.</strong> Tired legs + rocky terrain = rolled ankles. Take your time coming down.</li><li><strong>Celebrate.</strong> You just climbed one of the most significant mountains in the Northeast. Soak it in.</li></ul>"

Moderate difficulty.</li><li><strong>Sandy Stream Pond:</strong> Easy walk with excellent moose-watching opportunities.</li><li><strong>Chimney Pond:</strong> Stunning alpine pond at the base of Katahdin's dramatic cirque.</li></ul><h3>The Appalachian Trail Experience</h3><p>Even if you're not thru-hiking, consider the Hunt Trail for its AT connection. You'll walk the same miles that thousands of thru-hikers complete each year, and you might meet some at the summit celebrating their journey's end.</p>"
