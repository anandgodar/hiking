    "introduction": "<p>Slide Mountain stands as the Catskills' crown—at 4,180 feet, it's the highest peak in the range and a must-climb for anyone serious about New York hiking. Unlike the bare summits of the Adirondacks, Slide's peak is forested, but viewpoints along the trail reveal the Catskills spreading in every direction.</p><p>The mountain's name comes from a massive landslide that occurred in 1820, stripping trees from the southeastern face. Today, that slide path has regrown, but the name stuck. The trails through old-growth forest add to Slide's appeal—you're walking through centuries of history.</p>",

The climb is steady but never brutal, passing through beautiful second-growth and old-growth forest.</p><h3>Via Phoenicia-East Branch Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 9.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,500 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>A longer approach from the south, passing the summit of Giant Ledge along the way.
