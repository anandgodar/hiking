    "introduction": "<p>Some of the best views in the Adirondacks don't come from the highest peaks. Indian Head and Fish Hawk Cliffs sit at modest elevations—around 2,800 feet—but their cliff-edge positions above the Lower Ausable Lake create views that rival any summit. The Great Range rises dramatically across the valley, and the lake stretches below like a fjord.</p><p>Better still, these trails see a fraction of the traffic that clogs Cascade, Giant, or Marcy. You can often enjoy the cliffs in relative solitude, even on summer weekends when parking lots elsewhere are overflowing.</p>",

The approach is long but mostly gentle; the climbing comes in the final mile to each viewpoint.</p><h3>The Two Viewpoints</h3><p><strong>Fish Hawk Cliffs:</strong> The first viewpoint, looking east across Lower Ausable Lake toward Giant Mountain.</p><p><strong>Indian Head:</strong> Slightly higher and more dramatic, looking south with the Great Range rising directly across the lake.</p>"

        "heading": "The Experience",
        "content": "<h3>Lake Road</h3><p>The first 3+ miles follow a maintained road (closed to public vehicles) along the Ausable River. It's flat and easy, with pleasant forest scenery. Many hikers find this section tedious—consider it an opportunity to warm up for the climb ahead.</p><h3>The Climb</h3><p>From the Lake Road junction, trails lead uphill to the cliffs. The climbing is steady but not brutal, with rocky sections near the viewpoints.</p><h3>The Views</h3><p>The cliffs themselves are the reward. Sheer drops to the lake below, the Great Range rising across the valley, and a sense of wildness that's harder to find on the crowded peaks. Fish Hawk looks north and east; Indian Head looks south. Both are spectacular.</p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> The cliff edges are unprotected. Stay back from edges, especially in wet conditions.</p>"

The long approach keeps casual visitors away, leaving the cliffs to those willing to invest the miles. The payoff—sitting on the cliff edge with the Great Range filling the horizon—is worth every step.</p>",
