    "introduction": "<p>There's something special about hiking in Vermont. Maybe it's the way the Green Mountains roll endlessly toward the horizon, cloaked in the forests that give them their name. Maybe it's the small-town charm of the villages nestled in the valleys. Or maybe it's knowing that you're walking the same ridge that Long Trail thru-hikers have traversed for over a century.</p><p>Vermont may be small, but it packs incredible hiking into its borders. From the rocky alpine summit of Mount Mansfield to the rounded dome of Camel's Hump to the endless miles of the Long Trail, there's no shortage of adventure here.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Vermont has five peaks over 4,000 feet (the \"Vermont 5\"), the oldest long-distance hiking trail in the country (the Long Trail), and hundreds of miles of beautiful forest paths. The hiking here tends to be more forested than New Hampshire's White Mountains, but the alpine zones that do exist are spectacular.</p><h3>Key Ranges</h3><ul><li><strong>Northern Green Mountains:</strong> Mount Mansfield, Sterling Range</li><li><strong>Central Green Mountains:</strong> Camel's Hump, Abraham, Lincoln, Ellen</li><li><strong>Southern Green Mountains:</strong> Stratton, Glastenbury, Long Trail corridor</li></ul>"

        "content": "<h3>1. Mount Mansfield (Highest Peak)</h3><ul><li><strong>Elevation:</strong> 4,393 feet</li><li><strong>Best Route:</strong> Sunset Ridge Trail (5.4 mi RT, 2,550 ft gain)</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>Vermont's highest peak features extensive alpine terrain along a ridge that resembles a human profile. The Chin (highest point), Nose, and Adam's Apple form distinct features visible for miles.</p><p>The Sunset Ridge Trail offers the best hiking experience, with stunning above-treeline ridge walking. For a shorter option, take the toll road or gondola partway up.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The summit ridge is fragile alpine tundra. Stay on marked trails and rocks to protect the rare plants.</p><h3>2. Camel's Hump</h3><ul><li><strong>Elevation:</strong> 4,083 feet</li><li><strong>Best Route:</strong> Burrows Trail (4.4 mi RT, 2,200 ft gain)</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate-Strenuous</li></ul><p>Vermont's most iconic mountain, with its distinctive humped profile visible throughout the state. The bald summit offers 360-degree views, and it's the only undeveloped 4,000-footer in Vermont (no buildings or roads to the top).</p><p>The Burrows Trail is the most popular route—moderate grade, well-maintained, and direct to the summit. For a longer adventure, try the Monroe Trail or the Long Trail traverse.</p><h3>3. Mount Abraham</h3><ul><li><strong>Elevation:</strong> 4,006 feet</li><li><strong>Best Route:</strong> Long Trail from Lincoln Gap (5.0 mi RT, 1,700 ft gain)</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate-Strenuous</li></ul><p>A beautiful alpine summit with views across the Champlain Valley to the Adirondacks. The approach from Lincoln Gap is the shortest route. The summit area has extensive alpine vegetation—tread carefully.</p>"

        "content": "<p>The Long Trail is the oldest long-distance hiking trail in the United States, running 273 miles from Massachusetts to Canada along the spine of the Green Mountains. You don't need to thru-hike it to enjoy it—the trail offers incredible day hikes and sections throughout Vermont.</p><h3>Great Day Hike Sections</h3><ul><li><strong>Lincoln Gap to Mount Abraham:</strong> Alpine summit without huge mileage</li><li><strong>Appalachian Gap to Stark's Nest:</strong> Beautiful ridge walking</li><li><strong>Smugglers' Notch to Mount Mansfield:</strong> Traverse Vermont's highest peak</li></ul><h3>Overnight Adventures</h3><p>The Long Trail has a system of shelters spaced roughly every 5-10 miles. Multi-day sections are a great introduction to backpacking. The Monroe Skyline section (Camel's Hump to Mount Mansfield) is particularly scenic.</p>"

Stowe Pinnacle</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.8 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,520 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>A popular hike near Stowe with excellent views of Mount Mansfield and the surrounding valleys. The trail is steep but short, making it perfect for a morning or afternoon adventure.</p><h3>5. Sterling Pond</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.2 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 500 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy-Moderate</li></ul><p>A beautiful mountain pond via a short trail from Smugglers' Notch. Great for families and a nice add-on to a Mansfield hike. The pond sits at 3,000 feet and offers swimming in summer.</p><h3>6. Stratton Mountain</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 7.4 miles round trip (via Stratton Pond Trail)</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,900 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>A forested summit with a fire tower offering 360-degree views. Notable as the place where both the Long Trail and Appalachian Trail were conceived—James Taylor (Long Trail founder) and Benton MacKaye (AT founder) both found inspiration here.</p>"
