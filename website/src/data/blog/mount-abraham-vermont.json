    "introduction": "<p>Mount Abraham is special. At 4,006 feet, it's Vermont's fifth-highest peak, but more importantly, it's one of only three mountains in the state with true alpine tundra (the others being Mansfield and Camel's Hump). This rare high-altitude ecosystem—a relic of the last ice age—makes Abraham a destination for hikers who want to experience Vermont's wildest summit terrain.</p><p>The Long Trail crosses Abraham's summit, and the most popular approach from Lincoln Gap offers a relatively short but steep climb to the alpine zone. It's a challenging hike that rewards with far-reaching views and a genuine above-treeline experience.</p>",

The Long Trail heads north, climbing steeply through spruce-fir forest before emerging into the alpine zone for the final approach.</p><h3>Trail Character</h3><p>This isn't a gentle climb. The trail gains most of its elevation in about 2 miles, with rocky, rooty terrain throughout. Ladders and rock scrambles are common in the upper section. The reward is reaching the open alpine summit relatively quickly.</p>"

The plants here are tiny, tough, and ancient:</p><ul><li>Alpine bilberry</li><li>Mountain sandwort</li><li>Bigelow's sedge</li><li>Three-toothed cinquefoil</li></ul><h3>Protection</h3><p>This ecosystem is extremely fragile. The plants you step on may have taken decades to grow. Stay on marked trails and rock surfaces at all times. Even careful footsteps off-trail can cause lasting damage.</p><h3>Summit Views</h3><p>From Abraham's rocky summit, views extend in all directions:</p><ul><li>North: Mount Ellen and the ridgeline toward Camel's Hump</li><li>South: Lincoln Peak and the ski trails of Sugarbush</li><li>East: The Worcester Range and distant White Mountains</li><li>West: Lake Champlain and the Adirondacks</li></ul>"
