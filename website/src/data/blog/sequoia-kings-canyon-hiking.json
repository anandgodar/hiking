    "introduction": "<p>Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks are often overshadowed by their famous neighbor Yosemite, but they hold wonders all their own. Sequoia is home to the General Sherman Tree—the largest living thing on Earth by volume—and groves of ancient giants that make humans feel appropriately small. Kings Canyon plunges deeper than the Grand Canyon in places, carved by glaciers and time into one of the most dramatic landscapes in the Sierra Nevada.</p><p>Together, these adjacent parks offer everything from easy strolls among sequoias to multi-day backcountry expeditions. It's where superlatives become reality: the biggest, the deepest, the most awe-inspiring.</p>",

It's the largest single-stem tree on Earth. The short walk doesn't prepare you for the impact of standing before it.</p><h3>Congress Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.0 miles loop</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</li></ul><p>Extending from General Sherman, this loop passes more giants: the President, the Chief Sequoyah, and the Senate Group. The concentration of massive trees here is staggering.</p><h3>Giant Forest Loop</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 6.0 miles loop</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>A longer loop through the Giant Forest, connecting multiple groves and providing a deeper immersion in sequoia country. Fewer crowds than the main trails.</p><h3>Crescent Meadow</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 1.6 miles loop</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</li></ul><p>John Muir called Crescent Meadow \"the gem of the Sierra.\" This easy loop circles the flower-filled meadow, passing Tharp's Log—a fallen sequoia that served as a cabin.</p>"
