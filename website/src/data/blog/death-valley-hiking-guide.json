    "introduction": "<p>Death Valley holds records: the lowest point in North America (Badwater Basin at -282 feet), the hottest recorded air temperature on Earth (134°F), and some of the driest conditions anywhere. It sounds inhospitable, but for hikers willing to respect its extremes, Death Valley offers remarkable experiences—slot canyons, colorful badlands, high peaks, and a stark beauty found nowhere else.</p><p>The key is timing and preparation. Summer hiking can be deadly; winter and spring reveal a surprisingly accessible landscape with trails ranging from short walks to multi-day expeditions.</p>",
