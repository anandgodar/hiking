    "introduction": "<p>The Catskill Mountains rise just 100 miles northwest of New York City—close enough for a day trip, wild enough to feel like true wilderness. These ancient mountains once harbored the painters who founded the Hudson River School; today, they draw hikers to 98 named peaks, including 35 that rise above 3,500 feet.</p><p>While the Catskills lack the Adirondacks' height (Slide Mountain, the highest, reaches only 4,180 feet), they compensate with steep terrain, old-growth forest, dramatic waterfalls, and trails that feel surprisingly remote given their proximity to the largest city in the country.</p>",

The summit is mostly wooded, but viewpoints along the way reveal the surrounding mountains. A must-do for any Catskill list.</p><h3>Kaaterskill Falls</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 1.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 400 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy-Moderate</li></ul><p>At 260 feet total (two drops), Kaaterskill Falls is one of New York's tallest waterfalls. The short hike leads to a spectacular viewpoint. This is the most visited site in the Catskills—arrive very early on weekends.</p><h3>Devil's Path</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 25 miles end-to-end</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Very Strenuous</li></ul><p>Considered one of the most difficult trails in the Northeast, the Devil's Path traverses several major peaks with brutal elevation changes. Most hikers tackle sections rather than the full route.</p><h3>Blackhead Range</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 7.5 miles loop</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,500 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>Three peaks (Blackhead, Black Dome, Thomas Cole) in a single loop, with some of the best views in the Catskills.</p>"
