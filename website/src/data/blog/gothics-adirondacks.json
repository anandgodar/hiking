    "introduction": "<p>Gothics gets its name from its dramatic profile—sheer rock slides on its flanks that resemble Gothic architecture when viewed from a distance. At 4,736 feet, it's not the tallest High Peak, but it's arguably the most impressive. The summit offers some of the finest views in the Adirondacks, and the cable routes provide adventure unmatched elsewhere in the range.</p><p>For many hikers, Gothics represents a step up in commitment. The standard routes involve steep rock with fixed cables, serious exposure, and real mountain consequences. But for those ready for the challenge, it's the quintessential Adirondack experience.</p>",

The cable section is the highlight—and the crux—of the route. It requires climbing hand-over-hand up near-vertical rock.</p><h3>Via Armstrong and Upper Wolfjaw</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 14.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 4,200 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>An approach via the Great Range that includes Armstrong Mountain along the way. This adds peaks but provides a less technical route to Gothics' summit.</p><h3>Great Range Traverse</h3><p>Experienced hikers often include Gothics in the Great Range Traverse—hitting multiple peaks including Saddleback, Basin, and the Wolfjaws in a single epic day or overnight trip.</p>"

Know your limits. If the cables look beyond your comfort level, turn around—there are plenty of other High Peaks without technical terrain.</p>"

    "conclusion": "<h2>Quick Reference</h2><table><tr><th>Route</th><th>Distance</th><th>Gain</th><th>Technical?</th></tr><tr><td>Via Orebed Brook</td><td>12.0 mi</td><td>3,400 ft</td><td>Yes (cables)</td></tr><tr><td>Via Armstrong</td><td>14.0 mi</td><td>4,200 ft</td><td>Less so</td></tr></table><p>Gothics is the Adirondacks at their most dramatic—sheer rock, fixed cables, exposed summit, and views that make you forget the effort. It's not for everyone, and that's part of its appeal. For hikers ready to step up to more serious terrain, Gothics represents a genuine mountain achievement.</p>",
