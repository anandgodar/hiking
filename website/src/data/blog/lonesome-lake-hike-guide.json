    "introduction": "<p>Not every hike needs to be an epic. Sometimes you want beautiful mountain scenery without destroying your legs for the rest of the week. Lonesome Lake delivers exactly that.</p><p>This moderate hike climbs 1,000 feet through pleasant forest to reach a stunning alpine lake perched on the side of Cannon Mountain. From the shore, you'll gaze directly across at Franconia Ridge—the same dramatic peaks you'd see from the top, just from a different angle.</p><p>Add in an AMC hut serving fresh-baked cookies and cold lemonade, a loop trail around the lake, and the option to extend your adventure up Cannon Mountain, and you've got one of the most rewarding moderate hikes in the White Mountains.</p>",

        "content": "<h3>The Climb (1.3 miles)</h3><p>From Lafayette Place, the trail crosses under I-93 through a hiker tunnel, then begins climbing immediately. The ascent is steady but never brutal—a well-graded trail that gains elevation through mixed hardwood and spruce forest.</p><p>At about 0.7 miles, you'll reach a junction. Stay right on the Lonesome Lake Trail (the left option is the Cascade Brook Trail, which you can use for a loop return if desired).</p><p>The upper section of trail gets rockier, with a few steeper pitches, but nothing technical. Before you know it, the trees open up and you're at the lake.</p><h3>Lonesome Lake</h3><p>The lake appears suddenly, a mirror of blue-green water reflecting the ridgeline above. The Lonesome Lake Hut sits on the western shore, while a dock on the east side provides the classic Franconia Ridge view you've seen in countless photographs.</p><p>Spend some time here. Walk around the lake on the Cascade Brook Trail and Around the Lake Trail (adding 0.8 miles). Sit on the dock. Watch the reflection ripple when the breeze picks up.</p><h3>The Descent</h3><p>Return the way you came, or make a loop by descending via the Cascade Brook Trail for slightly different scenery. Either way, the descent is quick and easy—perfect tired-legs territory.</p>"

        "content": "<p>The Appalachian Mountain Club operates Lonesome Lake Hut, one of eight huts in the White Mountains. Even if you're not staying overnight, the hut is worth a visit.</p><h3>Day Visitor Info</h3><ul><li><strong>Snacks available:</strong> Fresh-baked cookies, brownies, hot chocolate, lemonade</li><li><strong>Restrooms:</strong> Composting toilets available to all hikers</li><li><strong>Water:</strong> Available for filter/treatment (or bring your own)</li></ul><h3>Staying Overnight</h3><p>Lonesome Lake Hut offers bunk accommodations with dinner and breakfast included. It's one of the easier huts to reach, making it perfect for families or first-time hut guests. Reservations required—book through the AMC website.</p><p>Staying overnight lets you catch sunset and sunrise at the lake, when the crowds disappear and the mountains glow pink and gold.</p>"

        "heading": "Extending Your Hike",
        "content": "<h3>Cannon Mountain via Kinsman Ridge</h3><p>From the hut, you can continue north on Kinsman Ridge Trail to reach Cannon Mountain's summit (4,080'). This adds 2.2 miles and 1,200 feet of climbing, making for a 7-mile day with 2,200 feet of total gain.</p><p>The views from Cannon are spectacular, and you can descend via the tramway (one-way ticket) if you don't want to retrace your steps.</p><h3>Hi-Cannon Trail Option</h3><p>Alternatively, take Hi-Cannon Trail from near the lake for a slightly shorter but steeper route to Cannon. This trail involves some scrambling and ladder sections—more adventurous but not for young kids.</p><h3>Kinsman Ridge South</h3><p>Heading south from the hut leads eventually to North Kinsman and South Kinsman mountains. This is a more serious undertaking—save it for another day unless you're looking for a big adventure.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>Seasonal Considerations</h3><ul><li><strong>Summer (June-August):</strong> Most popular time. Warm temps, bugs in June, swimming possible (cold!). Arrive early to beat crowds.</li><li><strong>Fall (September-October):</strong> Peak foliage season. Stunning colors reflected in the lake. Fewer bugs, cooler temps, smaller crowds on weekdays.</li><li><strong>Winter (November-April):</strong> Beautiful snowshoe destination. Trail is packed out by regular use. Bring microspikes at minimum.</li><li><strong>Spring (April-May):</strong> Muddy season. Not recommended—trails are soft and sensitive.</li></ul><h3>Time of Day</h3><p>Morning light at the lake is beautiful, but afternoon isn't bad either—the western location means the Franconia Ridge stays lit late. For the classic reflection shots, go early before wind picks up.</p>"
