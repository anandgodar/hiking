    "introduction": "<p>If you only do one hike in New Hampshire, make it Franconia Ridge.</p><p>I know that's a bold statement. The White Mountains have hundreds of amazing trails. But there's something about Franconia Ridge that just hits different. Maybe it's the nearly two miles of exposed ridgeline walking, where you feel like you're on top of the world. Maybe it's the way the trail connects three 4000-foot peaks in a single loop. Or maybe it's the views—endless, 360-degree, take-your-breath-away views that make all the climbing worth it.</p><p>Whatever it is, Franconia Ridge has ruined other hikes for me. And I mean that in the best possible way.</p>",

        "heading": "The Basics: What You're Getting Into",
        "content": "<p>Let's start with the numbers:</p><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 8.9 miles (full loop)</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 3,900 feet</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 6-9 hours</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li><li><strong>Peaks Bagged:</strong> Mount Lafayette (5,260'), Mount Lincoln (5,089'), Little Haystack (4,760')</li></ul><p>This isn't an easy hike. The elevation gain is significant, the ridge is exposed to weather, and you'll need to be in good physical condition to enjoy it. But if you're ready for a challenge, the payoff is absolutely worth it.</p><h3>The Three Peaks</h3><p><strong>Mount Lafayette</strong> is the star of the show—at 5,260 feet, it's the highest peak in the Franconia Range and offers commanding views in every direction. On a clear day, you can see all the way to Vermont, Maine, and even Canada.</p><p><strong>Mount Lincoln</strong> sits just south of Lafayette, connected by a stunning above-treeline ridge walk. The traverse between these two peaks is the highlight of the entire hike.</p><p><strong>Little Haystack</strong> is where you first emerge onto the ridge if you're hiking the loop counter-clockwise. It's the \"lowest\" of the three at 4,760 feet, but the views are just as spectacular.</p>"

        "heading": "Which Direction: Clockwise or Counter-Clockwise?",
        "content": "<p>This is probably the most common question about Franconia Ridge, and honestly, there's no wrong answer. But here's my take:</p><h3>Counter-Clockwise (Falling Waters → Ridge → Old Bridle Path)</h3><p>This is the most popular direction, and I think it's the better choice for most hikers. Here's why:</p><ul><li><strong>You save the best for last.</strong> The ridge walk comes in the middle of the hike when you still have energy to enjoy it.</li><li><strong>Easier descent.</strong> Old Bridle Path is a gentler grade going down, which is easier on your knees.</li><li><strong>Better waterfall views.</strong> Falling Waters Trail passes several beautiful cascades that are more dramatic heading up.</li></ul><h3>Clockwise (Old Bridle Path → Ridge → Falling Waters)</h3><p>Some hikers prefer this direction because:</p><ul><li><strong>Get the hardest climbing done first.</strong> Old Bridle Path is relentless, and some prefer to tackle it fresh.</li><li><strong>Fewer crowds on the ridge.</strong> Most people go counter-clockwise, so you'll pass them rather than follow them.</li><li><strong>Waterfall break on the descent.</strong> Nice reward at the end of a long day.</li></ul><p><strong>My recommendation:</strong> Go counter-clockwise unless you have a specific reason not to.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>The Falling Waters Approach (Counter-Clockwise)</h3><p><strong>Miles 0-1.5:</strong> The trail starts gently, following Walker Brook through beautiful hardwood forest. You'll cross several small streams and gain elevation gradually. This is the easy part—enjoy it.</p><p><strong>Miles 1.5-2.5:</strong> Now the waterfalls begin. First Cloudland Falls (80'), then the dramatic Shining Rock area, followed by the stunning Falling Waters cascade. Take time to enjoy these—they're some of the most beautiful falls in the White Mountains. The trail gets steeper here, with some rocky sections that require hand-over-hand scrambling when wet.</p><p><strong>Miles 2.5-3.4:</strong> Above the falls, the trail climbs relentlessly through scrubby spruce forest. This section is tough—steep, rocky, and seemingly endless. But suddenly, you'll pop out above treeline at Little Haystack Mountain.</p><h3>The Ridge Walk</h3><p><strong>Miles 3.4-5.3:</strong> This is it. This is why you came.</p><p>The ridge stretches out before you, a knife-edge of rock with nothing but sky on either side. You'll traverse Little Haystack, then make the exposed walk to Mount Lincoln, and finally climb to the summit of Mount Lafayette.</p><p>The trail is well-marked with cairns and painted blazes, but in fog it can be disorienting. Stay on the marked path—the alpine vegetation is fragile and takes decades to recover from trampling.</p><p>Weather can change quickly up here. If clouds roll in or you hear thunder, get below treeline immediately.</p><h3>The Old Bridle Path Descent</h3><p><strong>Miles 5.3-6.5:</strong> From Lafayette's summit, you'll descend the Greenleaf Trail to Greenleaf Hut (an AMC hut with snacks and water available). The views on this section are incredible—you can see the entire ridge you just traversed.</p><p><strong>Miles 6.5-8.9:</strong> From Greenleaf Hut, Old Bridle Path takes you back to the parking lot. It's steep and rocky in places, but more moderate than Falling Waters. Your knees will thank you for doing this section downhill.</p>"

        "heading": "What to Bring",
        "content": "<p>The ridge is exposed. Really exposed. Pack like you might encounter bad weather, because on Franconia Ridge, you very well might.</p><h3>Essential Gear</h3><ul><li><strong>Layers, layers, layers:</strong> Wind shell, fleece, rain jacket. Even on a \"nice\" day, the ridge can be 20+ degrees colder than the parking lot with significant wind chill.</li><li><strong>3+ liters of water:</strong> There's no reliable water above the falls. Greenleaf Hut sells water, but don't count on it.</li><li><strong>Plenty of food:</strong> This is an all-day hike. Bring more calories than you think you need.</li><li><strong>Sun protection:</strong> The ridge has zero shade. Sunscreen, hat, and sunglasses are essential.</li><li><strong>Trekking poles:</strong> Highly recommended, especially for the descent.</li><li><strong>Headlamp:</strong> Just in case. You should be off the ridge well before dark, but things happen.</li></ul><h3>What to Wear</h3><p>Moisture-wicking base layers, hiking pants (not cotton), sturdy boots with ankle support. Bring gloves and a warm hat even in summer—the ridge can feel like October when the wind picks up.</p>"

        "heading": "When to Go",
        "content": "<h3>Best Months</h3><p><strong>June through October</strong> is the primary hiking season. The ridge typically clears of snow by late May, but conditions vary year to year.</p><ul><li><strong>June:</strong> Snow may linger in shaded areas. Falling Waters can be spectacular with high water flow.</li><li><strong>July-August:</strong> Peak season. Expect crowds, but weather is generally most stable.</li><li><strong>September:</strong> Fall colors begin, crowds thin slightly, crisp air.</li><li><strong>October:</strong> Peak foliage season. Absolutely stunning, but be prepared for winter conditions at any time.</li></ul><h3>Weather Windows</h3><p>Check the <strong>Higher Summits Forecast</strong> before you go. You want:</p><ul><li>Winds under 30 mph</li><li>No chance of thunderstorms</li><li>Good visibility (what's the point of the ridge in fog?)</li></ul><p>If the forecast is marginal, consider waiting for a better day. Franconia Ridge in bad weather is miserable and potentially dangerous.</p><h3>Start Time</h3><p>Early. Like, <strong>6 AM early</strong>. Here's why:</p><ul><li>The parking lot fills up fast on nice weekends (often by 7 AM)</li><li>Afternoon thunderstorms are common in summer</li><li>You'll have the ridge more to yourself in the morning</li><li>You want plenty of buffer time</li></ul>"

On a nice Saturday in July, you might encounter hundreds of other hikers.</p><p>If that bothers you, here's how to minimize the crowds:</p><ul><li><strong>Go on a weekday:</strong> Tuesday-Thursday are dramatically quieter.</li><li><strong>Start at sunrise:</strong> You'll pass most people on your way down.</li><li><strong>Go in shoulder season:</strong> Late September and October see fewer visitors.</li><li><strong>Accept it:</strong> The ridge is popular for good reason. Sometimes you just have to embrace the shared experience.</li></ul><p>One more thing: the other hikers on Franconia Ridge are generally awesome. I've had great conversations, shared snacks with strangers, and made trail friends up there. The community is part of what makes it special.</p>"

        "heading": "Common Mistakes to Avoid",
        "content": "<h3>1. Starting Too Late</h3><p>I see people heading up Falling Waters at noon. Don't be that person. You'll be caught in the afternoon heat, potentially face thunderstorms, and end up descending in the dark.</p><h3>2. Underestimating the Weather</h3><p>It can be 70 degrees and sunny at the trailhead and 45 with 40 mph winds on the ridge. The weather changes fast. Bring layers even if you think you won't need them.</p><h3>3. Not Bringing Enough Water</h3><p>Three liters minimum. More if it's hot. There's no water above the falls, and you'll be sweating a lot on the climb.</p><h3>4. Ignoring the Descent</h3><p>The ridge is spectacular, but don't burn all your energy there. You still have a long, rocky descent ahead. Pace yourself.</p><h3>5. Walking Off Trail</h3><p>The alpine zone is fragile. Those tiny plants took decades to grow. Stay on the marked trail and step on rocks, not vegetation.</p>"

If you can, spend a night or two in the area.</p><h3>Stay at Greenleaf Hut</h3><p>The AMC's Greenleaf Hut sits just below the ridge, about a mile from Lafayette's summit. It's a full-service hut with bunk beds, dinner, and breakfast included. Staying here lets you catch sunset and sunrise on the ridge—an experience that'll change how you see the mountains.</p><p>Reservations fill up months in advance. Book early.</p><h3>Camp at Lafayette Place</h3><p>Lafayette Place Campground is right at the trailhead.
