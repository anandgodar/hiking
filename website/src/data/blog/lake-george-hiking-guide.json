    "introduction": "<p>Lake George has been called the \"Queen of American Lakes,\" and for good reason. This 32-mile-long glacial lake, studded with over 170 islands, sits at the southern edge of the Adirondacks in a setting that's been drawing visitors for centuries. The surrounding mountains rise steeply from the water, offering hiking trails with views that combine alpine drama with the beauty of one of America's clearest lakes.</p><p>Unlike the remote High Peaks, Lake George trails are accessible from the popular tourist town of the same name. You can hike to spectacular views in the morning and be eating ice cream by the lakefront in the afternoon.</p>",
