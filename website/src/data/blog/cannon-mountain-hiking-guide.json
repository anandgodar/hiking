    "introduction": "<p>Cannon Mountain has always been about contrasts. It's home to New England's first aerial tramway, yet its hiking trails rank among the more challenging 4,000-footer routes. The former Old Man of the Mountain once gazed from its cliffs, an icon that drew visitors for generations before collapsing in 2003. Today, the mountain remains a centerpiece of Franconia Notch, offering hikers steep trails with incredible rewards.</p><p>At 4,080 feet, Cannon is the lowest of New Hampshire's 48 four-thousand footers. But don't let that fool you—what it lacks in height, it delivers in rugged character. The trails here are rocky, root-covered, and steep. You'll earn every foot of elevation gain.</p>",

The Hi-Cannon connector is steep and rocky right from the start. Once you reach the Kinsman Ridge Trail, you'll traverse some exposed sections before the final push to the observation tower. This isn't a gentle introduction to 4,000-footer hiking—it's the real deal.</p><h3>Lonesome Lake Trail to Kinsman Ridge</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 6.8 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,400 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>A longer but arguably more interesting route that begins at Lonesome Lake, climbs past the AMC hut, and then tackles the steep ascent to the ridge. You get lake views, hut atmosphere, and summit satisfaction all in one hike.</p><h3>Aerial Tramway</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 0 miles (8-minute ride)</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy (on your legs, anyway)</li></ul><p>Sometimes the smart move is taking the tramway up and enjoying the summit without the sweat. No shame in it—the views from the observation tower are the same either way. You can also hike up and ride down, saving your knees for another day.</p>"

        "heading": "The Summit Experience",
        "content": "<p>Cannon's summit is developed—there's an observation tower, the tramway station, and the Cannonball Pub serving food and drinks. Some hikers find this anticlimactic after a challenging climb. Others appreciate a cold beverage with their mountain views.</p><p>The observation tower adds extra elevation for panoramic views. From the top, you look directly across at the Franconia Ridge, with Lafayette, Lincoln, and Little Haystack forming one of New England's most impressive ridgelines. On clear days, you can see Mount Washington and the Presidential Range to the northeast.</p><p>One unique feature: interpretive displays about the Old Man of the Mountain. The rock formation that once defined New Hampshire (it's still on the state quarter and license plates) may be gone, but its memory lives on here.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>Best Times to Visit</h3><ul><li><strong>Summer:</strong> Long days and (usually) dry trails. The tramway operates daily, making the hike-up-ride-down option available.</li><li><strong>Fall:</strong> Spectacular foliage views from the summit, particularly looking across at Franconia Ridge. Tramway runs through Columbus Day weekend.</li><li><strong>Winter:</strong> The ski area operates, but hiking trails are extremely challenging. Full winter gear, crampons, and experience required.</li></ul><h3>Parking and Access</h3><p>Park at the Cannon Mountain tramway lot in Franconia Notch State Park. There's a day-use fee during peak season. The trailhead is well-marked near the tramway base station.</p><h3>What to Bring</h3><ul><li>Extra layers—the summit is often 15-20 degrees cooler than the valley</li><li>Sturdy hiking boots (the trails are rocky and steep)</li><li>Cash or card for the tramway if you're riding down</li><li>Plenty of water—no reliable sources on the trail</li></ul>"

This creates a massive day (13+ miles) or makes for a great overnight with a stay at Lonesome Lake Hut.</li><li><strong>Cannon + Lonesome Lake:</strong> Combine the summit with a stop at the scenic AMC hut for a full day of variety.</li></ul><p>For most hikers, Cannon alone is plenty for a day. The trails are steep enough that adding mileage requires serious fitness and planning.</p>"
