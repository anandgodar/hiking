    "introduction": "<p>Ask Vermont hikers about their favorite local summit and Mount Hunger comes up more than any other. This 3,539-foot peak in the Worcester Range combines challenging terrain with a spectacular exposed granite summit and views that take in virtually every major peak in the northern Green Mountains.</p><p>The trail is steep and rocky—you'll earn your views—but the payoff is extraordinary. On a clear day, you can see from Killington in the south to Jay Peak near the Canadian border, with Mansfield, Camel's Hump, and the Whites of New Hampshire filling the panorama.</p>",
