    "introduction": "<p>Pico Peak lives in Killington's shadow—literally. This 3,957-foot summit sits just north of Vermont's second-highest peak, and most hikers pass through on their way to or from the more famous neighbor. Their loss: Pico offers a more interesting trail, better summit views, and a fraction of the crowds.</p><p>Accessed via the Long Trail, Pico delivers a quintessential Vermont hiking experience: steep forest trails, rocky outcrops with views, and the satisfaction of standing atop one of the Green Mountains' significant summits.</p>",

The trail climbs steadily through hardwood forest, passing the Inn at Long Trail, before steepening significantly for the final push to Pico Camp and the summit. A spur trail leads from Pico Camp to the actual peak.</p><h3>Via Killington Gondola (Summer)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 4.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,200 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>When Killington's K-1 Gondola operates in summer, you can ride up and hike the Long Trail north to Pico. This eliminates significant elevation gain but requires gondola fare and operating hours. Check with the resort for current schedules.</p><h3>Pico + Killington Loop</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 10+ miles</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Very Strenuous</li></ul><p>Ambitious hikers can bag both peaks in a single day, traversing the Long Trail between them. It's a long day but efficient for peak-baggers.</p>"
