    "introduction": "<p>There's a reason Ansel Adams spent his life photographing Yosemite. The valley's granite walls rise 3,000 feet straight up from the meadows. Waterfalls plunge thousands of feet in sheets of mist and thunder. Ancient sequoias stand as silent witnesses to millennia of seasons.</p><p>Yosemite is one of those places that lives up to the hype. Whether you're walking a flat valley loop or climbing the cables on Half Dome, every trail offers something worth remembering.</p><p>Here are the best day hikes in Yosemite, organized by difficulty—from easy valley strolls to epic summit adventures.</p>",

        "content": "<h3>The Valley vs. The High Country</h3><p>Yosemite has two distinct hiking experiences:</p><ul><li><strong>Yosemite Valley:</strong> The famous granite walls, waterfalls, and meadows. Most accessible, most crowded, most iconic views.</li><li><strong>High Country:</strong> Tuolumne Meadows and the backcountry. Higher elevation, alpine scenery, fewer crowds.</li></ul><h3>Key Logistics</h3><ul><li><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> $35/vehicle (7-day pass)</li><li><strong>Permits:</strong> Required for Half Dome and all overnight backcountry trips</li><li><strong>Season:</strong> Valley trails year-round; high country June-October</li><li><strong>Shuttle:</strong> Free valley shuttle serves major trailheads</li></ul>"

Half Dome</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 14-16 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 4,800 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Very Strenuous</li><li><strong>Permit:</strong> Required (lottery system)</li></ul><p>The ultimate Yosemite challenge. The final 400 feet ascend the famous cables—steel cables bolted into the rock allowing hikers to climb the 45-degree granite slope to the summit.</p><p>This is a full-day endeavor: 10-14 hours for most hikers. The cables are up from late May through October (conditions permitting). Permits are required and competitive—apply in the preseason lottery or try for daily lottery spots.</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> Do not attempt if thunderstorms are forecast. The cables attract lightning.</p><h3>2. Mist Trail to Vernal and Nevada Falls</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 5.4 miles round trip (to top of Nevada Fall)</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,900 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>Yosemite's most popular trail for good reason. You'll climb granite stairs alongside Vernal Fall (317 ft), get absolutely soaked in the mist (hence the name), then continue to Nevada Fall (594 ft).</p><p>The John Muir Trail provides an alternate, less steep return route. In spring when water is highest, the mist is so heavy you'll need rain gear.</p><h3>3. Yosemite Falls Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 7.2 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,700 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>Climb to the top of North America's tallest waterfall (2,425 feet total drop). The trail is steep and exposed, with incredible views of the valley and falls. The falls dry up by late summer, so visit in spring for the full experience.</p>"

Four Mile Trail to Glacier Point</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 9.6 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 3,200 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>Switchback up the valley wall to Glacier Point—one of the most famous viewpoints in the park. Half Dome, Vernal and Nevada Falls, and the entire valley spread out before you.</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Hike up and take the shuttle/tour bus down (when available) to save your knees.</p><h3>5. Mirror Lake Loop</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 5.0 miles (loop)</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 100 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</li></ul><p>A flat walk to a seasonal lake that reflects Half Dome in its still waters. The lake is best in spring; by late summer it's often a meadow. Beautiful in any season for the granite views.</p><h3>6. Valley View Trail / Bridalveil Fall</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 0.5 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> Minimal</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</li></ul><p>A short paved path to the base of Bridalveil Fall (617 ft). The spray can be intense in spring—hence the \"bridal veil\" effect. Wheelchair accessible for most of the trail.</p>"

This is quintessential High Sierra scenery—granite domes, subalpine forest, crystal-clear lakes. Open June-October.</p><h3>8. Lembert Dome</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.8 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 850 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>A glacier-polished granite dome with panoramic Tuolumne Meadows views. The trail includes some scrambling on rock slabs. Great for sunset.</p><h3>9. Clouds Rest</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 14.5 miles round trip (from Tenaya Lake)</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,300 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>Higher than Half Dome with equally stunning views—and no permit required. The summit knife-edge can be intimidating for those afraid of exposure, but the 360-degree High Sierra panorama is worth it.</p>"
