    "introduction": "<p>There's a sign at the base of Mount Washington that reads: \"The area ahead has the worst weather in America. Many have died there from exposure even in the summer. Turn back now if the weather is bad.\"</p><p>They're not kidding. At 6,288 feet, Mount Washington holds the record for the highest wind speed ever recorded at a surface station—231 mph. The summit regularly experiences hurricane-force winds, and the temperature can drop 30 degrees in minutes when clouds roll in.</p><p>But here's the thing: thousands of hikers summit Mount Washington safely every year. With proper preparation, the right route, and respect for the mountain's reputation, you can too. This guide will tell you everything you need to know.</p>",

        "heading": "Why Mount Washington Demands Respect",
        "content": "<p>Before we talk about trails and gear, let's be real about what you're getting into.</p><p>Mount Washington sits at the convergence of three major storm tracks. Cold air funnels up from the south, warm moist air pushes in from the Atlantic, and arctic air drops down from Canada. The result? Weather that changes faster than anywhere else in the Northeast.</p><h3>The Numbers Don't Lie</h3><ul><li><strong>Over 150 deaths</strong> on the mountain since records began</li><li><strong>Average summit temperature in July:</strong> 49°F (with wind chill often below freezing)</li><li><strong>Average wind speed:</strong> 35 mph (hurricane-force winds occur 110 days per year)</li><li><strong>Visibility below 1/4 mile:</strong> 55% of the time</li></ul><p>I'm not trying to scare you off. I'm trying to make sure you take this seriously. The hikers who get into trouble on Washington are usually the ones who underestimate it.</p>"

        "heading": "Best Trails to Hike Mount Washington",
        "content": "<p>There are multiple ways up Washington, ranging from relatively straightforward to genuinely technical. Here's the breakdown:</p><h3>Tuckerman Ravine Trail (Most Popular)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 8.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 4,250 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 6-9 hours</li></ul><p>This is the classic route that most hikers take. You'll start at Pinkham Notch Visitor Center, follow a well-maintained trail through the forest, then emerge into the alpine zone at Tuckerman Ravine—a stunning glacial cirque that's famous for spring skiing.</p><p>The trail is relentless. There's no easy section. But the footing is generally good, the route is well-marked, and you'll have plenty of company on busy days.</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> The headwall above Tuckerman Ravine can hold snow well into June. Check conditions before assuming it's a straightforward hike.</p><h3>Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 9.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 3,800 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 6-8 hours</li></ul><p>Starting from the Cog Railway base station, this trail offers a slightly different experience. You'll pass beautiful waterfalls in the lower section, then climb steeply to Lakes of the Clouds Hut before the final push to the summit.</p><p>I actually prefer this route in many ways—the waterfalls are gorgeous, and Lakes of the Clouds is a great place to take a break and refuel. The downside? The upper section can be brutally exposed in bad weather.</p><h3>Jewell Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 10.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 3,800 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate-Strenuous</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 6-8 hours</li></ul><p>If you want a slightly gentler approach, Jewell Trail is your best bet. The grade is more consistent, and you get beautiful views of the western Presidentials as you climb. You'll meet up with the Gulfside Trail before the final summit approach.</p><p>This is a great option for hikers who want to avoid the crowds on Tuckerman.</p><h3>Lion Head Trail (Winter Route)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 8.2 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 4,250 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Very Strenuous</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 7-10 hours</li></ul><p>In winter and early spring, when Tuckerman Ravine is an avalanche zone, Lion Head becomes the standard route. It's steeper and more exposed, but it avoids the dangerous terrain. If you're hiking between November and May, this is likely your route.</p><h3>Which Route Should You Choose?</h3><p>For first-timers in good weather: <strong>Tuckerman Ravine</strong>. It's the most popular for good reason—great scenery, well-maintained trail, and easy access from Pinkham Notch.</p><p>For hikers who want fewer crowds: <strong>Ammonoosuc Ravine</strong> or <strong>Jewell Trail</strong>.</p><p>For winter hikers: <strong>Lion Head Trail</strong> (mandatory avalanche safety knowledge required).</p>"

        "heading": "What to Bring: Gear Checklist",
        "content": "<p>Mount Washington requires more gear than a typical day hike. Here's what you need:</p><h3>The Non-Negotiables</h3><ul><li><strong>Extra layers:</strong> Even in July, bring a fleece AND a waterproof shell. Temps can drop to freezing on the summit.</li><li><strong>Rain gear:</strong> Full waterproof jacket and pants. Not water-resistant. Waterproof.</li><li><strong>Hat and gloves:</strong> Yes, even in summer. I've worn gloves on the summit in August.</li><li><strong>3+ liters of water:</strong> There are no reliable water sources on the upper mountain.</li><li><strong>Headlamp:</strong> With extra batteries. If something goes wrong, you might be out after dark.</li><li><strong>Map and compass:</strong> Cell service is spotty, and GPS can fail. Know how to navigate.</li><li><strong>High-energy food:</strong> More than you think you'll need. 2,000+ calories for a long day.</li></ul><h3>Footwear</h3><p>Sturdy hiking boots with ankle support. The upper mountain is rocky and unforgiving—this isn't the place for trail runners unless you really know what you're doing.</p><h3>What NOT to Bring</h3><ul><li><strong>Cotton anything:</strong> Cotton kills. It absorbs sweat, loses all insulating ability when wet, and will leave you hypothermic in bad weather.</li><li><strong>Jeans:</strong> See above. Wear synthetic hiking pants or shorts.</li><li><strong>Umbrella:</strong> The wind will destroy it in about three seconds.</li></ul>"

Snow typically melts out by late May or early June, and the first significant snowfall usually comes in October.</p><p>That said, \"summer\" on Mount Washington can feel like winter. Be prepared for any conditions regardless of the calendar date.</p><h3>Best Time of Day</h3><p><strong>Start early.</strong> I mean really early—5:00 or 6:00 AM is ideal. Here's why:</p><ul><li>Afternoon thunderstorms are common in summer</li><li>The summit is less crowded in the morning</li><li>You'll have a buffer if something takes longer than expected</li><li>Parking at Pinkham Notch fills up fast on weekends</li></ul><h3>Weekdays vs. Weekends</h3><p>If you can swing it, hike on a weekday. The difference is dramatic—you might have the trail mostly to yourself on a Tuesday, while a Saturday in July can feel like a highway.</p>"

Enjoy this part—it's the warmup.</p><h3>Above Treeline</h3><p>At around 4,000 feet, the trees disappear and you enter the alpine zone. This is where Mount Washington shows its true character. The wind picks up, the temperature drops, and you realize why everyone kept telling you to bring layers.</p><p>The above-treeline section is also where navigation becomes critical. In clear weather, the trail is obvious—just follow the cairns and painted blazes. In fog, it's a different story. Stay on the marked route.</p><h3>The Summit</h3><p>The summit of Mount Washington is... weird. There's a weather observatory, a visitor center, a cafeteria, and tourists who drove up the Auto Road in flip-flops. After hours of hiking through wilderness, it can feel jarring.</p><p>But don't let that diminish the accomplishment. You climbed New Hampshire's highest peak under your own power. Take a moment to appreciate that before heading back down.</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> The summit buildings are not emergency shelters. If conditions turn bad, get below treeline as quickly as safely possible.</p>"

Tired legs + rocky terrain = rolled ankles.</li><li><strong>Use trekking poles:</strong> They reduce stress on your knees and improve stability.</li><li><strong>Stay hydrated and fed:</strong> Keep eating and drinking even if you don't feel like it.</li><li><strong>Watch your footing:</strong> Especially on wet rocks.
