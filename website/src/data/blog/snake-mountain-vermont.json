    "introduction": "<p>Snake Mountain isn't part of the Green Mountains—it rises alone from the Champlain Valley, a 1,287-foot ridge that commands views across one of the most beautiful landscapes in the Northeast. From its rocky summit, you look west across Lake Champlain to the Adirondacks, east to the main Green Mountain spine, and down at a pastoral valley of farms and villages.</p><p>At just 3.6 miles round trip with about 900 feet of climbing, Snake Mountain is accessible to almost any hiker. It's popular with families, casual hikers, and anyone wanting big Vermont views without big Vermont elevation gain.</p>",
