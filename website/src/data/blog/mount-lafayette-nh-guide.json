    "introduction": "<p>Mount Lafayette stands as the monarch of Franconia Notch—at 5,260 feet, it's the highest peak north of the Presidential Range and the defining summit of the famous Franconia Ridge. From its bare summit cone, hikers look out across an alpine landscape that feels more like the Rockies than New England.</p><p>Lafayette is most often climbed as part of the Franconia Ridge Loop, one of the most popular hikes in New Hampshire. But it can also be tackled via shorter (though steeper) routes if the full loop is too ambitious. However you reach it, Lafayette rewards with world-class views and genuine alpine terrain.</p>",

Most hikers do it in this direction to tackle the steep Falling Waters section on descent.</p><h3>Greenleaf Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 6.8 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 3,500 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>The most direct route to Lafayette, climbing from the west side. It's shorter than the loop but misses the ridge traverse. Good option if weather limits your above-treeline time.</p><h3>Skookumchuck Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 10.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 3,400 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>The quietest approach, starting from I-93 and climbing the northwest ridge. You'll likely have more solitude, though the trail is longer and lacks the dramatic features of other routes.</p>"

To the south, the Franconia Ridge extends toward Mount Lincoln—nearly two miles of exposed ridge walking that many consider the finest alpine traverse in the eastern United States.</p><p>What you'll see from the top:</p><ul><li><strong>North:</strong> The Twin Range and Mount Washington in the distance</li><li><strong>South:</strong> The ridge extending to Lincoln and Little Haystack</li><li><strong>West:</strong> The Kinsman Range and Vermont's Green Mountains</li><li><strong>East:</strong> The Pemigewasset Wilderness, vast and roadless</li></ul><p>The summit features a USGS marker and often a crowd. Space is limited on the rocky top, so be prepared to share on busy days.</p>"

It makes a perfect rest stop on the way up or a base for exploring the ridge.</p><p>Day visitors can purchase snacks and lunch, use the facilities, and enjoy the deck views. Overnight guests get full meals and bunks—a wonderful way to split a long hike over two days.</p><p>The hut typically operates from late May through late October, with reservations recommended (and required for overnight stays). Book early for summer weekends.</p>"

Lightning, high winds, and rapid temperature drops are all possible. Plan to be off the exposed ridge by early afternoon if thunderstorms are forecast.</p>"
