    "introduction": "<p>If there's a gateway peak for New Hampshire hiking, it's Mount Major. This 1,786-foot summit above Lake Winnipesaukee offers views that rival mountains twice its size, all for a modest 1,200-foot climb. On any given weekend, you'll find everyone from young families to groups of friends to solo hikers enjoying this beloved trail.</p><p>The popularity has its drawbacks—parking can be a nightmare, and the summit often feels crowded. But there's a reason Mount Major is so beloved: it delivers real mountain rewards without requiring advanced skills or extreme fitness. For many people, this is where the hiking bug bites.</p>",

It's well-maintained, mostly shaded, and climbs at a steady but manageable grade. Expect rocks and roots but nothing technical. Most hikers complete the round trip in 2-3 hours.</p><h3>Brook Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 4.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,150 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy-Moderate</li></ul><p>A slightly longer alternative that follows a scenic brook for part of the way. This route tends to be less crowded than the Blue Trail and offers more solitude. It can be combined with the Blue Trail for a loop.</p><h3>Boulder Loop Trail</h3><p>For a longer adventure, this trail adds boulder fields and additional viewpoints. It's less traveled than the main routes and offers more challenging terrain.</p>"

On clear days, you can see the Ossipee Mountains, the Sandwich Range, and even hints of the White Mountains on the horizon.</p><p>The summit is spacious enough for crowds, with plenty of rocks to sit on while you enjoy your lunch. There's an old stone shelter near the top—a popular spot for photos and a reminder of the mountain's long history as a destination.</p><p>What you'll find:</p><ul><li>360-degree views (lake, mountains, forests)</li><li>Rocky summit for sitting and exploring</li><li>Historic stone shelter</li><li>Likely plenty of company on nice days</li></ul>"

        "content": "<p>Mount Major is hikeable year-round, but conditions vary:</p><ul><li><strong>Spring:</strong> Muddy conditions; trails can be wet. Still worth it for fewer crowds.</li><li><strong>Summer:</strong> Prime hiking season. Start early to beat the heat and the crowds.</li><li><strong>Fall:</strong> Spectacular foliage views over the lake. Peak weekends are extremely crowded.</li><li><strong>Winter:</strong> Beautiful with snow; microspikes recommended. Parking lot may not be plowed.</li></ul><h3>Timing Tips</h3><ul><li>Arrive before 8 AM on summer weekends to get parking</li><li>Weekday mornings are blissfully uncrowded</li><li>Sunset hikes are popular but require a headlamp for descent</li></ul>"

        "heading": "Practical Information",
        "content": "<h3>Parking</h3><p>The main trailhead is on Route 11 in Alton Bay. The parking lot fills early on nice weekends—often by 9 AM in summer and fall. Once the lot is full, there's no overflow parking nearby, and illegally parked cars get ticketed.</p><p>Pro tip: Come early or come on a weekday. There's no other solution to the parking problem.</p><h3>Fees</h3><p>No fee to park or hike.</p><h3>Dogs</h3><p>Dogs are allowed and very common. Keep them leashed, especially on the crowded summit.</p><h3>What to Bring</h3><ul><li>Water (no sources on trail)</li><li>Snacks for the summit</li><li>Sturdy shoes (rocks and roots throughout)</li><li>Layers (summit can be windy)</li></ul>"

    "conclusion": "<h2>Quick Reference</h2><table><tr><th>Trail</th><th>Distance</th><th>Gain</th><th>Difficulty</th></tr><tr><td>Blue Trail</td><td>3.6 mi</td><td>1,200 ft</td><td>Easy-Moderate</td></tr><tr><td>Brook Trail</td><td>4.0 mi</td><td>1,150 ft</td><td>Easy-Moderate</td></tr></table><p>Mount Major isn't the highest, toughest, or most remote hike in New Hampshire. But for pure view-to-effort ratio, it's hard to beat. That first glimpse of Lake Winnipesaukee from the summit is the moment that converts casual walkers into lifelong hikers. Just arrive early, bring good spirits for the crowds, and enjoy one of the most rewarding short hikes in the state.</p>",
