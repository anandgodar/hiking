    "introduction": "<p>Whiteface Mountain stands apart—literally. While most Adirondack High Peaks cluster together in the heart of the wilderness, Whiteface rises alone 15 miles to the north, its distinctive profile visible from Lake Placid and beyond. At 4,867 feet, it's the fifth-highest peak in New York and one of only two High Peaks accessible by road.</p><p>That road—the Veterans Memorial Highway—brings tourists to near the summit, but hikers can earn the views the traditional way. Multiple trails climb Whiteface from different directions, offering everything from a moderate approach to a challenging all-day adventure.</p>",

The trail climbs steadily, steeply in places, through forest before emerging onto open rock for the final approach. Views expand as you gain elevation.</p><h3>Connery Pond to Whiteface Landing</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 10+ miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 3,000 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 7-9 hours</li></ul><p>A less-traveled approach from the south via Connery Pond and Whiteface Landing on Lake Placid. Longer but with more variety, including waterfront scenery.</p><h3>Esther Mountain Combo</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 11+ miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 4,200 feet</li></ul><p>Bag two peaks by adding Esther Mountain (4,240'), accessible via a spur trail from the Wilmington Trail. Esther is a trailless peak that was officially added to the 46ers list. The herd path is now well-established.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>Lower Trail</h3><p>From the Wilmington trailhead, the first few miles climb steadily through classic Adirondack forest—mixed hardwoods giving way to spruce and fir. The trail is well-marked but rugged, with rocks and roots throughout.</p><h3>Upper Mountain</h3><p>Above 4,000 feet, the trees shrink and views begin opening. The final approach crosses alpine terrain with excellent views in all directions. You'll see Lake Placid, the High Peaks to the south, Lake Champlain to the east, and on clear days, Montreal to the north.</p><h3>The Summit</h3><p>Whiteface's summit is developed—there's a castle-like stone building (now a weather station), an observation deck, and in summer, tourists who drove up. Don't let this diminish your accomplishment; you earned it, they didn't. The 360-degree views are spectacular regardless of how you arrived.</p>"

Even if you hike, consider driving up another day for the experience.</p>"

It's now staffed by atmospheric researchers who monitor weather and climate data.</p>"
