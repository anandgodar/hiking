    "introduction": "<p>There's something about chasing waterfalls that never gets old. Maybe it's the anticipation as you hear the roar growing louder through the trees. Maybe it's that first glimpse of white water crashing over ancient granite. Or maybe it's just the excuse to stand in the cool mist on a hot summer day.</p><p>Whatever it is, New Hampshire delivers. The White Mountains are packed with waterfalls—from roadside cascades you can see in five minutes to remote gems that reward those willing to put in the miles. After years of exploring NH's waterfall trails, here are my favorites, organized by difficulty.</p>",

        "heading": "Easy Waterfall Hikes (Under 2 Miles)",
        "content": "<h3>1. The Flume Gorge</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 2 miles (loop)</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy (boardwalks and stairs)</li><li><strong>Fee:</strong> $18 adults, $16 kids (state park admission)</li></ul><p>Yes, it's touristy. Yes, there's an admission fee. But the Flume is genuinely spectacular—an 800-foot natural gorge with walls rising 90 feet on either side, waterfalls cascading through, and beautifully maintained boardwalks that make it accessible to almost everyone.</p><p>Come early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid the biggest crowds. The lighting is better then anyway.</p><h3>2. Diana's Baths</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 1.2 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</li><li><strong>Fee:</strong> $5 parking</li></ul><p>A series of cascading pools perfect for wading on a hot day. Diana's Baths is one of the most popular waterfall spots in the state—the smooth granite formations and multiple tiers make it ideal for families. On summer weekends, expect company.</p><p><strong>Best time:</strong> Early morning or weekdays. Avoid summer Saturday afternoons.</p><h3>3. Sabbaday Falls</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 0.6 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy (paved path)</li><li><strong>Fee:</strong> White Mountain pass required</li></ul><p>The easiest \"real\" waterfall hike on this list. A wide, paved path leads to a beautiful 45-foot cascade in a narrow flume. The whole trip takes maybe 20 minutes, making it perfect for a quick stop along the Kancamagus Highway.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>4. Arethusa Falls</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.6 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li><li><strong>Fee:</strong> $5 parking at trailhead</li></ul><p>At about 200 feet, Arethusa is the tallest single-drop waterfall in New Hampshire. The hike follows Bemis Brook through a beautiful forest, passing smaller cascades before reaching the main event.</p><p>The best flow is in spring or after heavy rain. By late summer, the falls can be more of a trickle. But even then, the setting is gorgeous.</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Continue past the falls to Frankenstein Cliff for amazing views of the valley below.</p><h3>5. Ripley Falls</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 1.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy-Moderate</li><li><strong>Fee:</strong> $5 parking at Ethan Pond trailhead</li></ul><p>A short but scenic hike to a 100-foot cascading waterfall. Ripley Falls is less crowded than some of the more famous spots, and the trail passes through beautiful forest. Can be combined with Arethusa Falls for a longer day (about 5 miles total via the Arethusa-Ripley Falls Trail).</p><h3>6. Glen Ellis Falls</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 0.3 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy (stairs)</li><li><strong>Fee:</strong> Free (roadside stop)</li></ul><p>A quick stop right off Route 16 in Pinkham Notch. A short trail with stairs leads down to a viewing area beside this powerful 65-foot waterfall. It's one of the easiest waterfalls to access in the White Mountains—perfect if you're driving by and want a quick waterfall fix.</p><h3>7. Falling Waters Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 5.0 miles (to Little Haystack and back)</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous (but waterfalls are in the first 2 miles)</li><li><strong>Fee:</strong> $5 parking at Lafayette Place</li></ul><p>Part of the famous Franconia Ridge Loop, Falling Waters passes multiple beautiful cascades including Cloudland Falls, Swiftwater Falls, and the trail's namesake Falling Waters. You don't need to do the full ridge hike—just go up to Cloudland Falls (1.5 miles) for a great waterfall experience.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>8. Thoreau Falls</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 9.2 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate-Strenuous</li><li><strong>Fee:</strong> White Mountain pass required</li></ul><p>Named for Henry David Thoreau (who explored this region in the 1800s), this remote waterfall requires some effort to reach. The trail follows the scenic Ethan Pond Trail through beautiful backcountry. The falls themselves are a wide cascade on the North Fork of the Pemigewasset River.</p><p>This is a full-day hike, but the remoteness means you might have the falls to yourself.</p><h3>9. Zealand Falls</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 5.6 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li><li><strong>Fee:</strong> $5 parking at Zealand trailhead</li></ul><p>A relatively easy hike (mostly flat) leading to Zealand Falls and the AMC Zealand Falls Hut. The falls are right beside the hut, which offers snacks and drinks for day hikers. The setting is spectacular—you can sit on the rocks beside the falls with views of the Pemigewasset Wilderness.</p><h3>10. Kinsman Falls</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 6.4 miles round trip (to Lonesome Lake)</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li><li><strong>Fee:</strong> $5 parking at Lafayette Place</li></ul><p>On the way to Lonesome Lake, you'll pass beautiful Kinsman Falls. The main destination is the stunning mountain lake with views of Franconia Ridge, but the falls along the way are a nice bonus. You can also continue to the AMC Lonesome Lake Hut.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>11. Beaver Brook Cascades</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> Variable (cascades line the trail)</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous (steep terrain)</li><li><strong>Fee:</strong> Free</li></ul><p>This is the trail you take to climb Mount Moosilauke from the south, but you don't need to summit to enjoy the waterfalls. The first mile of trail passes dozens of cascades as it climbs steeply alongside Beaver Brook. It's like hiking through a continuous waterfall.</p><p>Be warned: the trail is steep and can be slippery when wet. But if you're up for it, it's one of the most beautiful waterfall experiences in the state.</p><h3>12. Crystal Cascade</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 0.8 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy-Moderate</li><li><strong>Fee:</strong> None (starts from Pinkham Notch)</li></ul><p>On the lower portion of the Tuckerman Ravine Trail, Crystal Cascade is an often-overlooked 60-foot waterfall. Most hikers are focused on Mount Washington and pass right by. Take a moment to enjoy it—the cascade is beautiful, especially in spring when snowmelt swells the flow.</p>"

        "heading": "Best Times for Waterfall Hikes",
        "content": "<h3>Spring (April-May)</h3><p>Peak waterfall season. Snowmelt means maximum water flow. Some trails may have icy sections or be muddy.</p><h3>Early Summer (June)</h3><p>Still good flow, trails have dried out, weather is pleasant. Ideal time for most waterfall hikes.</p><h3>Mid-Summer (July-August)</h3><p>Water levels drop significantly. Many falls become trickles. Best for wading pools like Diana's Baths.</p><h3>Fall (September-October)</h3><p>Water flow varies. The combination of fall foliage and waterfalls can be stunning. Crowds pick up during peak foliage.</p><h3>After Heavy Rain</h3><p>Any waterfall is more impressive after rainfall. If we've had a few wet days, that's the time to go chase waterfalls.</p>"

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>Bring a change of clothes.</strong> You're going to want to get close to the falls, and mist happens.</li><li><strong>Watch your footing.</strong> Rocks near waterfalls are often wet and slippery. More people are injured slipping near waterfalls than you'd expect.</li><li><strong>Respect the water.</strong> Don't swim above waterfalls, and be extremely cautious about entering the water at the base. Currents can be stronger than they appear.</li><li><strong>Go early.</strong> Popular waterfalls get crowded by mid-morning on nice days.</li><li><strong>Bring a waterproof phone case.</strong> For those inevitable mist shots.</li></ul>"
