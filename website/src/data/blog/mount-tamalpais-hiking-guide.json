    "introduction": "<p>Mount Tamalpais—Mount Tam to locals—is the Bay Area's backyard mountain. Rising 2,571 feet just north of the Golden Gate Bridge, it's visible from across the region and accessible to millions. But familiarity hasn't bred contempt; Mount Tam remains genuinely spectacular, with ancient redwood groves, sweeping coastal views, and a trail network that could take years to fully explore.</p><p>The mountain is credited with helping birth mountain biking (the first modern mountain bikes descended these fire roads in the 1970s) and has been a hiking destination since the 1800s. Today, over 200 miles of trails crisscross the mountain's flanks, connecting state parks, national monuments, and open spaces into one vast hiking paradise.</p>",
