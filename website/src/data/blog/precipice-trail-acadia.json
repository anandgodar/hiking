    "introduction": "<p>The Precipice Trail is Acadia National Park's most notorious hike—a route up the sheer east face of Champlain Mountain using iron rungs, ladders, and nerve. It's only 1.6 miles round trip, but those numbers mean nothing when you're clinging to a cliff face with the Atlantic Ocean spread out hundreds of feet below.</p><p>This isn't hiking in the traditional sense. It's scrambling, climbing, and confronting your relationship with heights. The Precipice is Acadia's ultimate adventure trail—and also its most dangerous. It requires good weather, dry conditions, and an honest assessment of your comfort with exposure.</p>",

The exposure is real—fall from the exposed sections and you're in serious trouble.</p><p>Most hikers ascend Precipice and descend via the Champlain North Ridge Trail, a longer but conventional hiking path.</p>"

        "heading": "What to Expect",
        "content": "<p>Let's be clear about what you're signing up for:</p><ul><li><strong>Iron rungs:</strong> Metal bars bolted into rock faces that you climb like a ladder, but sometimes horizontally across cliff faces</li><li><strong>Ladders:</strong> Actual metal ladders bridging gaps in the rock</li><li><strong>Narrow ledges:</strong> Paths that are sometimes less than two feet wide with significant drop-offs</li><li><strong>Exposure:</strong> Long sections where you're climbing with hundreds of feet of open air beside you</li></ul><p>The trail is well-maintained and the hardware is secure. People complete it safely every day. But there's no margin for error—slipping or panicking at the wrong moment has consequences.</p><h3>Who Should Attempt It?</h3><p>You need:</p><ul><li>Comfort with heights and exposure</li><li>Reasonable upper body strength</li><li>Agility to navigate awkward positions</li><li>Calm under pressure</li><li>Good footwear with grip</li></ul><p>Who should skip it: anyone with fear of heights, children under about 10, people with mobility limitations, or anyone hiking in wet conditions.</p>"

        "heading": "Seasonal Closures",
        "content": "<p>The Precipice Trail closes seasonally to protect nesting peregrine falcons. The closure typically runs from mid-March through mid-August, though exact dates vary based on falcon activity.</p><p>During this time, the trail is physically closed—and violating the closure carries federal penalties. It's not optional; it's the law.</p><p>Before planning your trip, check the National Park Service website for current closure status. Late summer and fall offer the best window for climbing the Precipice.</p>"

Still thrilling, but a step down in intensity.</p><h3>Jordan Cliffs Trail</h3><p>Ladders and cliffside hiking with views of Jordan Pond. Closed during falcon season like Precipice.</p><h3>Champlain Mountain via Beachcroft Path</h3><p>Want to summit Champlain without the exposure? This beautifully constructed stone staircase offers a challenging but conventional route to the same summit.</p>"
