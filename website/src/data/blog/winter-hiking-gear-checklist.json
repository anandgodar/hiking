    "introduction": "<p>Winter hiking in New England is a serious undertaking. Temperatures can plunge below zero, winds can exceed 100 mph above treeline, and conditions change rapidly. Having the right gear isn't just about comfort—it's about survival.</p><p>This guide breaks down exactly what you need for safe winter hiking, from essential traction devices to emergency gear that could save your life.</p>",

        "heading": "Traction Devices: Non-Negotiable",
        "content": "<p>Every winter hiker needs traction devices. Period. Here's what to choose:</p><p><strong>Microspikes</strong> - Essential for packed snow and moderate ice. Brands like Kahtoola and Hillsound are industry standards. Use on well-traveled trails below treeline. ($30-70)</p><p><strong>Crampons</strong> - Needed for steep ice, exposed terrain, and above-treeline travel. Choose 10-12 point mountaineering crampons for serious winter peaks. Pair with compatible boots. ($100-250)</p><p><strong>Snowshoes</strong> - Required when breaking trail through deep snow. Look for aggressive traction with heel lifters. MSR, Tubbs, and Atlas are reliable brands. ($150-350)</p><p><strong>When to use what:</strong></p><ul><li>Packed, icy trail → Microspikes</li><li>Fresh snow over 8\" → Snowshoes</li><li>Steep ice, above treeline → Crampons</li><li>Varied conditions → Carry both microspikes and snowshoes</li></ul>"

        "content": "<p>Cold feet end hikes. Invest in proper winter footwear:</p><p><strong>Insulated Winter Boots</strong> - Look for boots rated to -40°F or below. Brands like Salomon, La Sportiva, and Scarpa make excellent options. Ensure compatibility with crampons if you'll use them. ($200-400)</p><p><strong>Gaiters</strong> - Keep snow out of your boots. Full-length gaiters are essential for deep snow travel. Outdoor Research and Black Diamond make durable options. ($40-80)</p><p><strong>Sock System</strong></p><ul><li>Liner sock (moisture-wicking)</li><li>Midweight wool sock (insulation)</li><li>Avoid cotton at all costs</li></ul>"

Never cotton. Brands: Smartwool, Patagonia Capilene, Icebreaker. ($50-100)</p><p><strong>Mid Layer</strong> - Insulating layer that retains heat. Fleece (Patagonia R1) or down/synthetic puffy (Patagonia Nano Puff, Arc'teryx Atom). ($100-250)</p><p><strong>Shell Layer</strong> - Waterproof, windproof outer layer. Hardshell jacket and pants for above-treeline travel. Gore-Tex or equivalent. ($200-500)</p><p><strong>Insulating Layer</strong> - Heavy puffy for summits and emergencies. Down or synthetic, 800+ fill power for down. Carry even if you don't think you'll need it. ($200-400)</p><p><strong>Head/Hands/Feet</strong></p><ul><li>Warm hat (wool or fleece, covers ears)</li><li>Balaclava for above treeline</li><li>Insulated gloves + warm mittens as backup</li><li>Hand warmers (backup heat source)</li></ul>"
