    "introduction": "<p>Vermont has two waterfalls named Moss Glen Falls—one in Granville and one in Stowe. Both are beautiful, but the Stowe version is particularly impressive: a 125-foot cascade dropping over a stepped rock face, framed by lush moss and ferns. It's just a short walk from the parking area, making it accessible to almost everyone.</p><p>The falls are especially dramatic in spring when snowmelt swells the stream, but they're worth visiting any time the trails are clear. Photographers particularly love the soft light of overcast days, when the falls seem to glow against the green moss.</p>",

The final approach involves some rock steps and can be slippery when wet—use caution, especially with children.</p><p>A viewing platform provides the classic view of the falls, but adventurous visitors can scramble closer (carefully) for different perspectives.</p>"
