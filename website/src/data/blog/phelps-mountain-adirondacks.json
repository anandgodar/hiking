    "introduction": "<p>Phelps Mountain sits in the heart of the High Peaks, surrounded by giants like Marcy, Colden, and the MacIntyre Range. At 4,161 feet, it's not among the tallest, but its central location provides some of the best views in the Adirondacks—a panorama of the peaks that define this wilderness.</p><p>For hikers progressing through the 46ers, Phelps represents a natural step up from Cascade. It's longer and more remote, requiring a hike past Marcy Dam, but the terrain is manageable and the rewards are substantial.</p>",

Marcy Dam—where the dam washed out years ago—offers a scenic rest stop with mountain views.</p><h3>Phelps Trail (2.1 miles)</h3><p>From Marcy Dam, the Phelps Trail branches east, climbing more steeply through spruce-fir forest. The upper section can be muddy but is well-marked. The final approach to the summit involves some rock scrambling.</p><h3>The Summit</h3><p>Phelps' summit is a rocky outcrop with excellent views in all directions:</p><ul><li>Mount Marcy dominates the southwest</li><li>The MacIntyre Range rises to the west</li><li>Table Top and Colden are prominent to the south</li><li>The Great Range stretches southeast</li></ul><p>It's one of the best viewing platforms in the High Peaks—you're surrounded by wilderness icons.</p>"
