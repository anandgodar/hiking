    "introduction": "<p>Little River State Park is Vermont's hidden treasure for family hiking. Located in the hills above Waterbury Reservoir, the park features a network of trails passing through a landscape rich in history—abandoned farms, old cellar holes, and the remnants of communities that thrived here before the dam was built in the 1930s.</p><p>The trails are well-maintained and mostly moderate, making them perfect for families with kids, casual hikers, or anyone wanting a relaxed day in the woods. Add excellent camping, swimming in the reservoir, and proximity to Stowe, and you have one of Vermont's best outdoor destinations.</p>",
