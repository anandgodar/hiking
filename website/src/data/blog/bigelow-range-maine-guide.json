    "introduction": "<p>There's a mountain range in western Maine that feels like it doesn't quite belong—too dramatic, too alpine, too good to be true. The Bigelow Range rises sharply above Flagstaff Lake, its ridgeline stretching for miles with two 4,000-foot summits, exposed rock, and views that can make you forget you're not in the Rockies.</p><p>The Appalachian Trail traverses the entire range, making this a pilgrimage for thru-hikers and day hikers alike. For my money, the Bigelow traverse is the finest ridge walk in Maine—maybe in all of New England. It's long, challenging, and absolutely spectacular.</p>",

        "heading": "The Peaks",
        "content": "<h3>Avery Peak (4,090')</h3><p>Named for Myron Avery, one of the founders of the Appalachian Trail, this is Bigelow's highest summit. The exposed rock top offers 360-degree views including Flagstaff Lake below and Katahdin on the horizon.</p><h3>West Peak (4,145')</h3><p>Technically Maine's third-highest summit (after Katahdin and Hamlin Peak), West Peak anchors the western end of the ridge with similarly dramatic views. A fire warden's cabin once stood here.</p><h3>South Horn and North Horn</h3><p>These sub-peaks add character to the range and offer different perspectives. The Horns Trail provides an alternative approach.</p>"

Starting from Stratton Brook Pond Road, this trail climbs steadily with the final mile above treeline. It's the shortest approach to alpine terrain.</p><h3>The Full Traverse (Avery to West Peak)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 12-14 miles (depending on start/end points)</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 4,500+ feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Very Strenuous</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 9-12 hours</li></ul><p>The classic Bigelow experience follows the AT across the entire ridge, tagging both major summits. This requires a car shuttle or very long day. Most hikers do it as an overnight, staying at Horns Pond lean-tos.</p><h3>Horns Pond Approach</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 10 miles round trip (to West Peak)</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,600 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 7-9 hours</li></ul><p>From the Horns Pond trailhead, climb to the beautiful Horns Pond, then continue on the AT to West Peak. Can be combined with Avery for a full day.</p>"

        "heading": "The Ridge Experience",
        "content": "<h3>Above Treeline</h3><p>The Bigelow ridge spends considerable time above treeline, with exposed rock and stunted krummholz. In good weather, this is hiking nirvana—panoramic views in every direction, with Flagstaff Lake glittering below and mountains stretching to the horizon.</p><h3>Weather Considerations</h3><p>The exposed ridge means serious weather exposure. Wind, fog, and cold can arrive quickly. Come prepared with layers, rain gear, and navigation skills. If thunderstorms threaten, get below treeline immediately.</p><h3>The AT Connection</h3><p>The Appalachian Trail traverses the entire Bigelow Range, making this a highlight section for thru-hikers. You'll likely meet some if you hike here—their perspective on the mountains is worth a conversation.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>Getting There</h3><p>Bigelow is located near Stratton and Eustis in western Maine. The Fire Warden's Trail starts from Stratton Brook Pond Road; the Horns Pond Trail starts from a trailhead on Route 27.</p><h3>Parking</h3><p>Small lots at trailheads—arrive early on summer weekends. No fees.</p><h3>Water</h3><p>Horns Pond provides reliable water (treat it). Otherwise, carry everything you need.</p><h3>Overnight Options</h3><p>Horns Pond lean-tos offer overnight camping on the ridge (first-come, first-served). Staying overnight lets you catch sunrise or sunset on the summit—highly recommended.</p>"
