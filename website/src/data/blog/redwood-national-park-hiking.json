    "introduction": "<p>Standing among coast redwoods is a humbling experience. These trees—some over 2,000 years old and 350 feet tall—are the largest living things on Earth by volume. Walking through a redwood grove feels like entering a cathedral, with shafts of light filtering through the canopy far above and a silence that feels sacred.</p><p>Redwood National and State Parks (jointly managed) protect much of the remaining old-growth redwood forest. The hiking here is unlike anywhere else: fern-filled canyons, elk-dotted meadows, misty groves, and always, the presence of these ancient giants.</p>",
