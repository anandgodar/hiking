    "introduction": "<p>Ask any Adirondack hiker where to start the 46er journey, and they'll probably say Cascade Mountain. At 4,098 feet, it's not the highest of the Adirondack High Peaks, but it might be the most beloved—and for good reason.</p><p>Cascade offers everything that makes High Peaks hiking special: a challenging but manageable climb, open rock summit with 360-degree views, and that unmistakable Adirondack wilderness feeling. The trail is well-maintained, the parking is accessible, and the views from the top are genuinely world-class. If Marcy is the king of the High Peaks, Cascade is the friendly ambassador welcoming everyone to the realm.</p><p>It's also popular—extremely popular. But don't let that deter you. Cascade earned its popularity honestly, and sharing the summit with other hikers is part of the experience.</p>",

The final push involves some scrambling over open rock ledges with increasingly dramatic views.</p><h3>What to Expect</h3><ul><li><strong>First mile:</strong> Moderate climb through pleasant forest</li><li><strong>Mile 1-2:</strong> Trail steepens, roots and rocks increase</li><li><strong>Final section:</strong> Open rock with scrambling; cairns mark the route</li><li><strong>Summit:</strong> Bald rock dome with expansive views</li></ul>"

GPS: 44.2188° N, 73.8867° W</p><h3>Parking Situation</h3><p>This is the catch with Cascade. The parking lot is small (~30 cars), and it fills up early—often by 7 AM on summer weekends. Options:</p><ul><li>Arrive very early (before 7 AM on weekends)</li><li>Go on weekdays</li><li>Use the shuttle from Lake Placid (seasonal)</li><li>Wait for a spot—turnover is decent as early hikers return</li></ul><p><strong>Important:</strong> Do not park illegally on Route 73. Enforcement is strict and towing common.</p>"

Porter Mountain (4,059 feet) is connected to Cascade by a 0.7-mile spur trail from near the summit.</p><ul><li><strong>Added Distance:</strong> ~1.4 miles</li><li><strong>Added Elevation:</strong> ~400 feet (some down, some up)</li><li><strong>Added Time:</strong> 1-1.5 hours</li></ul><h3>Is It Worth It?</h3><p>If you're working on the 46 or just want more hiking, yes. Porter's summit is more wooded with limited views from the true high point, but a viewpoint just below offers nice vistas. The trail between the peaks is pleasant.</p><p>If Cascade alone is plenty of challenge for you, that's completely fine—it's a satisfying hike on its own.</p>"
