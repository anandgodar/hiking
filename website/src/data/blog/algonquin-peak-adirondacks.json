    "introduction": "<p>Algonquin Peak is arguably the most rewarding hike in the Adirondacks. At 5,114 feet, it's second only to Mount Marcy in elevation, but many hikers prefer it—the summit views are spectacular, the approach is more direct, and you're surrounded by the dramatic MacIntyre Range rather than looking at it from a distance.</p><p>The standard route from Adirondak Loj climbs 8 miles round trip with nearly 3,000 feet of elevation gain. It's challenging but achievable for fit hikers, and the payoff—standing on that exposed alpine summit with the High Peaks arrayed around you—is worth every step.</p>",

The climb is relentless but well-graded, with the final mile above treeline.</p><h3>With Wright Peak</h3><p>Many hikers add Wright Peak (4,580 feet), which branches off the Algonquin trail about halfway up. This adds approximately 0.8 miles and 300 feet of elevation, bagging two High Peaks in one trip.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>Lower Section: Loj to Wright/Algonquin Junction</h3><p>The first 2+ miles follow the well-traveled Van Hoevenberg Trail, crossing Marcy Brook and climbing moderately through mixed forest. At the trail junction, bear left toward Wright and Algonquin (right continues to Marcy).</p><h3>Middle Section: To Wright Spur</h3><p>The trail steepens as you climb toward the Wright Peak junction. Many hikers tag Wright first, then return to continue up Algonquin. The forest becomes increasingly alpine, with stunted spruce and fir.</p><h3>Upper Section: Above Treeline</h3><p>The final mile to Algonquin is spectacular—open alpine terrain with views expanding with every step. Cairns mark the route across exposed rock. In clear weather, you can see most of the major High Peaks from the trail.</p><h3>The Summit</h3><p>Algonquin's summit is a broad, rocky expanse with 360-degree views. Mount Colden rises dramatically across Avalanche Pass. Marcy looms to the east. The Great Range extends southeast. And on clear days, Lake Champlain and Vermont are visible to the east.</p>"

The spur trail to Wright branches off the main trail and adds about an hour round trip.</p><h3>Iroquois Peak</h3><p>From Algonquin's summit, a rugged trail continues to Iroquois Peak (4,840 feet). This adds 1.5 miles round trip and requires descending and re-ascending—it's a significant addition to an already long day.</p><h3>The MacIntyre Traverse</h3><p>Strong hikers can traverse the entire MacIntyre Range: Wright, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Marshall. This is a very long day (13+ miles) requiring early start and good conditions.</p>"
