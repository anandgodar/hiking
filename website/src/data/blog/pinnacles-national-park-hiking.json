    "introduction": "<p>Pinnacles National Park is California's hidden gem—America's newest national park (designated 2013) and one of its most underrated. Volcanic spires rise hundreds of feet above the chaparral, talus caves offer underground exploration, and endangered California condors soar overhead. All this, and most visitors have never heard of it.</p><p>Located inland from the Salinas Valley, Pinnacles rewards hikers with dramatic rock formations, spring wildflowers, and wildlife viewing opportunities that rival any park in the state. It's also an excellent cool-season destination when higher mountains are buried in snow.</p>",
