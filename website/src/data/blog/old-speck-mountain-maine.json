    "introduction": "<p>Old Speck is Maine's third-highest peak, rising to 4,170 feet at the northern end of the rugged Mahoosuc Range. It's a mountain with character—steep trails, a restored fire tower with 360-degree views, and a position at the gateway to some of the toughest hiking on the Appalachian Trail.</p><p>Located in Grafton Notch State Park, Old Speck combines with nearby attractions like Screw Auger Falls and Table Rock to make this area a hiking destination in its own right. But the peak itself is the main draw—a challenging climb rewarded with some of the best views in western Maine.</p>",

The trail is steep and relentless, gaining elevation steadily through spruce-fir forest. A spur trail leads from the AT to the fire tower at the summit. Expect 5-7 hours for the round trip.</p><h3>Link to Eyebrow Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 8.0 miles loop</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,950 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>Add variety by incorporating the Eyebrow Trail, which passes dramatic cliffs with views into Grafton Notch. The loop is slightly longer but adds scenic interest to the descent.</p><h3>Mahoosuc Trail Connection</h3><p>Old Speck sits at the north end of the Mahoosuc Range. From the summit, you can continue south on the AT toward Mahoosuc Notch (the famous \"toughest mile\") and beyond. This is backpacking territory—serious, rugged, and rewarding for prepared hikers.</p>"
