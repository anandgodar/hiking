    "introduction": "<p>Lye Brook Falls claims the title of Vermont's tallest waterfall—a 160-foot cascade plunging off a cliff in the heart of the Lye Brook Wilderness. Unlike many New England waterfalls visible from roadsides, this one requires effort: a 4.6-mile round trip hike through beautiful forest to a viewpoint of the falls.</p><p>The journey is as rewarding as the destination. You'll hike through mature hardwood forest along a pleasant stream before the trail steepens for the final approach to the falls overlook. It's a genuine wilderness experience just minutes from the resort town of Manchester.</p>",

The walking is easy at first—wide path, gentle grade, pleasant stream sounds. After about a mile, the trail leaves the old road and becomes a true hiking path, climbing more steeply toward the falls.</p><p>The final approach involves some steeper sections and rock steps before reaching the viewing area.
