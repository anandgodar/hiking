    "introduction": "<p>For much of the year, Cadillac Mountain is where the sun first touches the United States. At 1,530 feet, it's the highest point on the Atlantic coast north of Brazil, and its summit offers panoramic views across Acadia National Park, the Atlantic Ocean, and the islands of Frenchman Bay.</p><p>While many visitors drive the summit road, hiking provides a more intimate experience with this iconic peak. Multiple trails climb Cadillac's flanks, each offering distinct character and challenge. And if you're willing to start before dawn, you can be standing on top when the first rays of light hit American soil.</p>",

        "content": "<h3>South Ridge Trail (Most Popular)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 7.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,350 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>The classic hiking route, starting near Blackwoods Campground and climbing gradually along Cadillac's southern ridge. The trail is well-marked and mostly moderate, with several open ledge sections offering views south toward Otter Point and the ocean.</p><h3>North Ridge Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 4.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,100 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>The most direct route, climbing from the park road via open granite slopes. Excellent views throughout, including Bar Harbor and the outlying islands. This is the best choice for sunrise—shorter distance means less pre-dawn hiking.</p><h3>Gorge Path</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 4.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,100 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate-Strenuous</li></ul><p>The most dramatic approach, following a narrow ravine up the mountain's eastern side. Dense forest, cascading water (in spring), and a sense of adventure make this a favorite despite steeper sections.</p><h3>Cadillac West Face</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.8 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,000 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>The shortest and steepest route, climbing directly up the mountain's western face. Some scrambling required. Not the best choice for sunrise (you'd be facing away from the view) but good for an afternoon climb.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>The Experience</h3><p>Watching sunrise from Cadillac is a pilgrimage. On clear mornings, you'll join dozens (or hundreds) of people gathered on the summit, watching the eastern horizon lighten before the sun breaks free of the ocean. The light paints the islands and water in shades of pink and gold.</p><h3>Planning Tips</h3><ul><li>Check sunrise times—they vary dramatically by season (4:52 AM in June vs 6:59 AM in November)</li><li>Cadillac is only \"first sunrise\" from roughly October through March; in summer, other East Coast locations see it first</li><li>Summit road reservations may be required (check current NPS policies)</li><li>For hiking, start 2-3 hours before sunrise, depending on trail choice</li></ul><h3>What to Bring</h3><ul><li>Headlamp with extra batteries</li><li>Warm layers (summit is cold pre-dawn)</li><li>Hot beverage in a thermos (makes the wait pleasant)</li><li>Camera gear for photography</li></ul>"

        "content": "<p>Cadillac is worth hiking any time of day:</p><ul><li><strong>Sunset:</strong> Western views over Somes Sound and the mountains; often equally spectacular</li><li><strong>Midday:</strong> Best visibility for long-distance views; fewer crowds than dawn or dusk</li><li><strong>Fall foliage:</strong> The summit provides a bird's-eye view of Acadia's colors</li></ul><p>The summit has interpretive signs, a gift shop (in season), and ample room to roam the granite slabs. It's not a wilderness experience—the road brings many visitors—but the views transcend the crowds.</p>"
