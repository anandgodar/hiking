    "introduction": "<p>The Kinsman Range doesn't get the attention of nearby Franconia Ridge, but make no mistake—these are serious mountains. North Kinsman (4,293 ft) and South Kinsman (4,358 ft) offer challenging hiking, rugged terrain, and views that rival their more famous neighbors. The trails here are steeper and rockier than most, making this a true test for aspiring 4,000-footer completionists.</p><p>Both peaks can be climbed together in a single strenuous day, or combined with a stay at Lonesome Lake Hut for a more relaxed overnight adventure. Either way, be prepared to work for your views.</p>",

You'll return via the Fishin' Jimmy Trail and Kinsman Pond. This loop is long and includes multiple steep sections—allow 7-9 hours.</p><h3>From Kinsman Notch</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 9.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 3,200 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>Starting from the Kinsman Ridge Trail on Route 112, this approach tackles both peaks from the west. The trail is relentlessly steep with less variety than the loop, but it's a bit shorter overall.</p><h3>Via Mount Kinsman Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 10.8 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 3,600 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>An out-and-back from Easton that passes several beautiful cascades early on.

South Kinsman offers excellent views of the Franconia Ridge, while North Kinsman looks across to the Cannon cliffs and beyond.</p>"

        "content": "<p>One of the AMC's most accessible huts, Lonesome Lake sits at 2,760 feet on the lower slopes of the Kinsmans. It's a perfect base for dividing the climb into two days:</p><ul><li><strong>Day 1:</strong> Hike to the hut (1.6 miles, 1,000 feet), enjoy dinner and evening by the lake</li><li><strong>Day 2:</strong> Climb to North and South Kinsman, return via the hut</li></ul><p>The hut serves breakfast and dinner, offers bunk accommodations, and has that wonderful AMC atmosphere. The lake itself is beautiful, with the Kinsman Ridge reflected in its waters.</p><p>Day visitors are welcome for lunch and rest stops. Overnight reservations book early—plan well ahead for summer weekends.</p>"

For backpackers, this makes an excellent overnight destination:</p><ul><li>Carry water treatment (pond water is available)</li><li>Fee required for shelter/camping (self-service caretaker)</li><li>Spectacular sunrise over the ridge</li></ul><p>The pond is worth a visit even on a day hike—a peaceful spot to rest before or after tackling the summits.</p>"
