    "introduction": "<p>Noonmark Mountain sits at 3,556 feet—just short of the 4,000-foot threshold for Adirondack High Peak status. This accident of elevation is your gain. While hikers queue up for the 46ers, Noonmark offers a challenging climb to a spectacular open summit with views that rival any mountain in the range.</p><p>Rising dramatically above Keene Valley, Noonmark is the prominent peak you see from Route 73, its distinctive profile drawing the eye. The summit provides one of the best panoramas in the Adirondacks: the Great Range stretches before you, with Gothics, Saddleback, and Basin presenting their imposing faces. It's the kind of view that makes you question whether peak-bagging has its priorities straight.</p>",

You gain elevation rapidly through hardwood forest, transitioning to conifers as you climb. The final section emerges onto open rock with increasingly dramatic views. This route is steep but efficient, delivering you to the summit in the shortest distance.</p><h3>Felix Adler Trail (From Route 73)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 5.6 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,300 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>This route starts lower and gains more elevation but is slightly more gradual in grade. It approaches from the south side of the mountain. Many hikers prefer a loop combining both trails with a short road walk between trailheads.</p>"

Many photographers prefer Noonmark over the High Peaks themselves because you can actually see the High Peaks from here.</p><h3>Summit Character</h3><p>Exposed rock with room to spread out. Unlike some popular 46ers, you won't feel crowded. Bring layers—wind can be significant.</p>"

    "conclusion": "<h2>Quick Reference: Noonmark Mountain</h2><table><tr><th>Detail</th><th>Information</th></tr><tr><td>Summit Elevation</td><td>3,556 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Distance (Stimson)</td><td>4.4 miles round trip</td></tr><tr><td>Elevation Gain</td><td>2,200 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Difficulty</td><td>Strenuous</td></tr><tr><td>46er Status</td><td>No (below 4,000 ft)</td></tr></table><p>Noonmark Mountain proves that elevation lists don't tell the whole story. This non-46er delivers views that rival any Adirondack summit, crowds that don't rival any popular peak, and a legitimate challenge that earns every vista. If you're hiking for the experience rather than the checklist, Noonmark should be near the top of your list.</p>",
