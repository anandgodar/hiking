    "introduction": "<p>Hidden in the forests of Crawford Notch, Arethusa Falls drops nearly 200 feet over a sheer granite cliff—making it New Hampshire's tallest single-drop waterfall. Named after a mythological Greek nymph who was transformed into a spring, Arethusa has been drawing visitors since the grand hotel era of the 1800s.</p><p>The hike is moderate in difficulty, making this spectacular waterfall accessible to most hikers. Spring brings the most impressive water flow when snowmelt swells the streams, but Arethusa is worth visiting any time the trails are clear.</p>",

        "content": "<h3>Arethusa Falls Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.6 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 900 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li></ul><p>The trail begins near Willey House Station in Crawford Notch State Park and follows Bemis Brook upstream toward the falls. You'll cross the brook on a footbridge, climb through hemlock forest, and eventually hear the falls before you see them.</p><p>The trail is well-maintained but rooty in places, with a few short steep sections. Most reasonably fit hikers complete the round trip in 2-3 hours, including time to enjoy the falls.</p>"

        "heading": "At the Falls",
        "content": "<p>When you arrive, you'll understand why Arethusa has drawn visitors for over 150 years. The water drops from a notch in the cliff above, cascading down the rock face before collecting in a pool at the base. In spring, the flow is powerful and loud; by late summer, it gentles to a lacier stream.</p><p>There's an observation area at the base of the falls, but some hikers scramble closer on the rocks (use caution—wet rocks are slippery). The spray from the falls creates a cool microclimate that feels wonderful on hot summer days.</p><p>Photography tips: morning light is best, as the falls face east. A longer exposure will give that silky water effect. In peak flow, you'll likely get some spray on your lens.</p>"

        "heading": "Extended Hikes",
        "content": "<p>If the 2.6-mile round trip isn't enough, several options let you extend the adventure:</p><h3>Arethusa-Ripley Falls Loop</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 4.5 miles</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,300 feet</li></ul><p>Continue past Arethusa Falls to connect with Ripley Falls, another beautiful 100-foot cascade. This loop returns via Ethan Pond Trail and Ripley Falls Trail, passing the scenic Willey Range along the way. It's one of the best waterfall-focused hikes in the White Mountains.</p><h3>Frankenstein Cliff Trail</h3><p>For views instead of more waterfalls, this trail climbs to dramatic clifftop overlooks of Crawford Notch. Can be combined with Arethusa for a longer loop.</p>"

Look for the Arethusa Falls parking lot on the east side of the road.</p><h3>Fees</h3><p>No fee for the trailhead parking lot. The nearby Crawford Notch State Park facilities may have a day-use fee.</p><h3>Dogs</h3><p>Dogs are allowed on leash. Some stream crossings and rock scrambles may be challenging for dogs.</p>"
