    "introduction": "<p>Skylight Pond is one of those places that rewards the effort to reach it. Sitting at 3,420 feet in the Breadloaf Wilderness, this clear mountain pond reflects the surrounding spruce and fir forest like a mirror. There's a rustic shelter, backcountry camping, and the kind of quiet that only comes from being miles from the nearest road.</p><p>The hike isn't easy—most routes involve significant elevation gain and distance—but Skylight Pond delivers the authentic Vermont backcountry experience that makes the Long Trail famous.</p>",
