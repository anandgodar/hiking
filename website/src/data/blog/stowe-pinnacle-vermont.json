    "introduction": "<p>If you only have time for one hike in Stowe, make it the Pinnacle. This 2,740-foot summit just east of the famous resort town packs panoramic views of Mount Mansfield, Camel's Hump, and the surrounding Green Mountains into a moderate 2.8-mile round trip. It's the kind of hike that converts casual walkers into lifelong hikers.</p><p>The trail is steep in places and rocky throughout—this is Vermont, after all—but the payoff is substantial. Standing on the bare summit with mountains in every direction, you'll understand why people fall in love with this state.</p>",
