    "introduction": "<p>Most mountain hikes end with views of more mountains. Camden Hills ends with views of Penobscot Bay—sailboats bobbing in the harbor, islands scattered across blue water, and the Atlantic stretching toward the horizon. It's a view that stops you in your tracks.</p><p>Camden Hills State Park sits on Maine's mid-coast, where the Appalachian Mountains make their final push toward the sea. The hills aren't huge by New Hampshire or Vermont standards—the highest point is just over 1,300 feet—but the ocean backdrop makes them feel much grander. And the hiking here is genuinely good: challenging enough to feel accomplished, rewarding enough to understand why this area has drawn visitors for generations.</p><p>Whether you want a quick leg-stretcher with a view or a full day exploring the ridge trail, Camden Hills delivers.</p>",

        "content": "<h3>Mount Battie Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 1.0 mile round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 600 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate (steep but short)</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 45 minutes-1 hour</li></ul><p>The classic Camden hike. Mount Battie is the iconic peak visible from town, topped with a stone observation tower built in 1921. The trail climbs steeply through forest to the summit, where views of Camden Harbor and the bay unfold spectacularly.</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> There's an auto road to the summit, so expect company at the top. Hike up, let the drivers marvel at your accomplishment, then descend feeling superior.</p><h3>Mount Megunticook via Ridge Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 5.4 miles round trip (from nature center)</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,100 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate-Strenuous</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 3-4 hours</li></ul><p>Megunticook is the park's highest point and offers different views than Battie—more of the Camden Hills themselves, plus dramatic looks down the coast toward Acadia. The Ridge Trail is the most scenic approach, with open ledges and panoramic vistas.</p><p>The actual summit is wooded, but Ocean Lookout (0.3 miles before the summit) provides the money view.</p><h3>Megunticook-Battie Traverse</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 5.0 miles (point to point)</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,400 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 4-5 hours</li></ul><p>Connect Megunticook and Battie via the Ridge Trail for a full day on the heights. You'll need a car shuttle or to walk the road back, but the ridge walking is excellent.</p><h3>Maiden Cliff Trail</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 800 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 1-1.5 hours</li></ul><p>A short hike to dramatic cliffs overlooking Megunticook Lake. A memorial cross marks where a young girl fell in 1864—sobering history, but the views are spectacular. Good option when you want something different from the bay views.</p>"

        "heading": "Trail Details",
        "content": "<h3>Trail Conditions</h3><p>Trails in Camden Hills are well-maintained but can be rocky and rooty in places. The Ridge Trail has some exposure and scrambling that may concern those afraid of heights—nothing technical, but attention is required.</p><p>In spring and after rain, trails can be muddy and slippery. Sturdy footwear recommended.</p><h3>Wildlife</h3><p>Expect to see woodland birds, squirrels, and possibly deer. Turkey vultures soar over the ridges, and hawks ride the thermals. Offshore, you might spot seals on the rocks.</p><h3>Navigation</h3><p>The park provides a basic trail map at the entrance station. Trails are well-marked with blazes and signs. The ridge area has multiple interconnecting trails, so pay attention to junctions.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>Summer</h3><p>Prime tourist season in Camden means crowds, but the hiking is excellent. Long days, warm temps, and clear air for views. Arrive early to beat the rush—parking can fill by 10 AM on summer weekends.</p><h3>Fall</h3><p>Peak foliage season (late September-mid October) brings stunning colors and slightly fewer crowds. The combination of fall colors and ocean blue is something special.</p><h3>Spring</h3><p>Mud season is real—trails can be wet and eroded. Consider hiking elsewhere or sticking to lower-elevation paths.</p><h3>Winter</h3><p>The park is open year-round and sees winter hiking traffic. Snowshoes or microspikes needed after snow. The ridge can be windswept and icy.</p>"

After your hike, grab lobster on the harbor or ice cream on Main Street.</p><h3>Windjammer Cruises</h3><p>Camden is the windjammer capital of Maine. Historic tall ships offer day sails and multi-day cruises—a completely different way to experience the coast you just admired from above.</p><h3>Nearby Hiking</h3><ul><li><strong>Ragged Mountain:</strong> A few miles south, with a popular ski area and good hiking</li><li><strong>Beech Hill:</strong> Easy walk to a blueberry barren with sea views</li><li><strong>Acadia National Park:</strong> An hour north, with world-class hiking</li></ul>"
