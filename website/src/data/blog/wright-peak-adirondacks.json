    "introduction": "<p>Wright Peak stands at 4,580 feet in the heart of the Adirondack High Peaks, offering one of the more accessible 46er summits. While many High Peaks require epic distances or brutal terrain, Wright can be summited in a moderate day via its spur trail off the Algonquin route.</p><p>The summit is completely bare—a rocky dome with views in every direction. It's also a site of somber significance: in 1962, a commercial airplane crashed on Wright's slopes, and a memorial commemorates the tragedy. The combination of accessible alpine terrain and meaningful history makes Wright a special destination.</p>",
