    "introduction": "<p>Stratton Mountain holds a special place in American hiking history. In 1921, forester and conservationist Benton MacKaye sat on this summit and conceived the idea that would become the Appalachian Trail—a continuous footpath from Georgia to Maine. Today, both the AT and Long Trail cross Stratton's 3,940-foot summit, and a historic fire tower provides panoramic views that stretch across southern Vermont.</p><p>The mountain also neighbors Stratton Pond, the largest body of water on the Long Trail, making this area a destination for day hikers and backpackers alike.</p>",
