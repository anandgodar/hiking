    "introduction": "<p>Ocean Path is Acadia National Park's signature coastal trail—and for good reason. This 2.2-mile path hugs the rocky shoreline from Sand Beach to Otter Point, passing Thunder Hole, Monument Cove, and the dramatic Otter Cliffs along the way. It's the quintessential Acadia experience, offering the perfect combination of accessibility and natural beauty.</p><p>The trail is nearly flat and well-maintained, making it suitable for almost everyone. Yet the scenery—pink granite, crashing surf, twisted pines—is world-class. No visit to Acadia is complete without walking at least part of Ocean Path.</p>",

This means you can walk any portion—just Sand Beach to Thunder Hole, or the full length to Otter Point, or any section in between.</p><p>Most people walk north to south (Sand Beach to Otter Point) to have the sun at their back for photography, though both directions are equally rewarding.</p>"

        "heading": "Highlights Along the Path",
        "content": "<h3>Sand Beach</h3><p>The northern trailhead at Sand Beach—one of the few sand beaches in Acadia, formed from crushed shells. It's a popular swimming spot (for the brave—water temperatures rarely exceed 55°F), and the surrounding pink granite cliffs are stunning.</p><h3>Thunder Hole</h3><p>About 0.5 miles south of Sand Beach, Thunder Hole is a natural rock formation where waves crash into a narrow inlet, creating a thunderous boom. Timing matters—the effect is best at mid-tide with significant swells. Calm days produce little drama.</p><h3>Monument Cove</h3><p>A small rocky cove with a sea stack called \"The Monument.\" It's worth the short detour from the main path.</p><h3>Otter Cliffs</h3><p>Rising 110 feet above the water, these are the highest sea cliffs on the Atlantic coast north of Brazil. The view from the top—or from the carriage road below—is spectacular.</p><h3>Otter Point</h3><p>The southern terminus offers beautiful views back along the coast and across Frenchman Bay. It's a fine spot to rest before heading back or catching the bus.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>Getting There</h3><p>The trail parallels Ocean Drive (the one-way section of Park Loop Road). Access points include:</p><ul><li>Sand Beach parking lot (fills early in summer)</li><li>Thunder Hole parking area</li><li>Otter Cliffs/Otter Point parking</li></ul><h3>Shuttle Option</h3><p>The Island Explorer bus (free, summer only) stops at Sand Beach and Otter Cliff, making it easy to walk one way and bus back.</p><h3>Best Times</h3><ul><li><strong>Early morning:</strong> Best for photography and avoiding crowds</li><li><strong>Mid-tide with swells:</strong> Best for Thunder Hole</li><li><strong>Shoulder season:</strong> May-June and September-October have fewer visitors</li></ul><h3>Accessibility</h3><p>Most of the path is relatively flat and compacted gravel, though some rocky sections require careful footing. It's not fully wheelchair accessible but is manageable for most mobility levels.</p>"
