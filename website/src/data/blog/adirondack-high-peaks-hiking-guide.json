    "introduction": "<p>Six million acres. The largest publicly protected area in the lower 48 states. Forty-six peaks over 4,000 feet. The Adirondack Park is a wilderness unlike anything else east of the Mississippi, and its High Peaks region is a hiking destination that rivals anything in New England.</p><p>The Adirondacks feel different from the White Mountains or Green Mountains. They're wilder, more remote, with longer approaches and fewer crowds (mostly). The peaks themselves are rugged—rocky summits, steep slides, and dense forest that gives way to alpine zones on the highest summits.</p><p>If you're looking for serious hiking with a wilderness feel, the Adirondacks deliver.</p>",

        "content": "<h3>The 46ers</h3><p>The Adirondack Forty-Sixers are hikers who have climbed all 46 High Peaks—mountains that were historically believed to be over 4,000 feet. (Modern surveys show four are actually under 4,000 feet, but they're still on the list for historical reasons.)</p><p>The 46ers club was founded in 1937, and completing the challenge is a badge of honor for Northeast hikers. Unlike NH's 4000-footers, many Adirondack peaks are trailless, requiring navigation skills and bushwhacking.</p><h3>The Great Range</h3><p>The most dramatic concentration of High Peaks, including Marcy, Haystack, Basin, Saddleback, Gothics, Armstrong, and Upper/Lower Wolfjaw. The Great Range Traverse is one of the most challenging day hikes in the Northeast.</p><h3>Logistics</h3><ul><li><strong>Trailheads:</strong> Major access from Adirondak Loj (Heart Lake) and Garden parking lot</li><li><strong>Permits:</strong> Day-use permits required for some trailheads (free, reserve online)</li><li><strong>Base Towns:</strong> Lake Placid, Keene Valley, Keene</li></ul>"

        "content": "<h3>1. Mount Marcy</h3><ul><li><strong>Elevation:</strong> 5,344 feet (highest in NY)</li><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 14.8 miles round trip (from Adirondak Loj)</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 3,166 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>New York's highest peak and the crown jewel of the Adirondacks. The summit is above treeline with dramatic views in all directions. The standard route from Adirondak Loj via Van Hoevenberg Trail is long but well-marked.</p><p>This is a full-day endeavor—plan for 10+ hours. An overnight at Marcy Dam or Lake Colden makes it more manageable.</p><h3>2. Algonquin Peak</h3><ul><li><strong>Elevation:</strong> 5,114 feet (second highest in NY)</li><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 8.4 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,936 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>Many consider Algonquin the best hiking in the High Peaks—shorter than Marcy with equally impressive views. The Van Hoevenberg Trail offers a direct route, and you can add Wright Peak (another 4000-footer) with minimal extra effort.</p><h3>3. Cascade and Porter</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 6.8 miles round trip (both peaks)</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,130 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate-Strenuous</li></ul><p>The most popular 46er peaks due to accessibility and excellent views. Cascade has a beautiful open summit; Porter is more forested but adds a second peak with minimal additional effort. The parking lot fills early—arrive before 6 AM on summer weekends.</p>"

Giant Mountain</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 6.2 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 3,050 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>One of the most visually striking peaks, with extensive open rock faces visible from the valley. The Ridge Trail is steep but scenic. Often combined with Rocky Peak Ridge for a challenging traverse.</p><h3>5. Gothics</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 11.0 miles round trip (from Garden)</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,700 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Very Strenuous</li></ul><p>The iconic peak of the Great Range with distinctive rock slides visible from miles away. The approach via Orebed Brook and the cables route is an adventure. Not for those afraid of exposure.</p><h3>6. Big Slide</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 9.4 miles round trip (via Slide Mountain Brook Trail)</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,800 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>A quieter alternative to the most popular peaks, with excellent views of the Great Range.

Parking fills fast.</li><li><strong>Expect longer days:</strong> ADK trails are often rougher than White Mountain trails. Add 25% to your expected time.</li><li><strong>Bring bug protection:</strong> Black flies in May-June and mosquitoes in July can be brutal.</li><li><strong>Carry a map:</strong> Many trails are less well-marked than in NH/VT. Navigation skills matter.</li><li><strong>Pack extra layers:</strong> Weather can change quickly, and summits are exposed.</li><li><strong>Practice Leave No Trace:</strong> The High Peaks are loved to death.
