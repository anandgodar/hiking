    "introduction": "<p>Sugarloaf is best known as one of the largest ski resorts in the East, but in summer its 4,237-foot summit becomes a worthy hiking destination. As Maine's second-highest peak (after Katahdin), Sugarloaf offers serious elevation gain, varied terrain, and summit views that stretch across the western Maine mountains.</p><p>The mountain's cone shape and ski-cleared slopes make it visually dramatic from every angle. For hikers, the challenge is real—you'll gain over 2,000 feet on most routes, much of it steep and rugged. But the reward is standing atop one of Maine's premier peaks.</p>",

This is the longest route but offers the most wilderness experience, passing through beautiful spruce-fir forest before the final steep climb to the summit.</p><h3>Via Ski Area (Timberline Trail)</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 4.0 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,100 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li></ul><p>The most direct route starts at the ski area base and climbs via service roads and trails to the summit. It's shorter than the AT route but steeper, and you'll share the mountain with summer resort activities.</p><h3>Combining with Spaulding Mountain</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 11.0+ miles</li></ul><p>For peak-baggers, Sugarloaf can be combined with nearby Spaulding Mountain (4,010 ft), another Maine 4,000-footer. The AT connects the two, making for a long but efficient day.</p>"

It's a true above-treeline experience despite the nearby development.</p>"

Climbing Maine's second-highest peak delivers a genuine mountain experience—steep trails, alpine scenery, and views that remind you why these western Maine peaks deserve more attention.
