    "introduction": "<p>The 100-Mile Wilderness is the most remote section of the entire Appalachian Trail—a hundred miles between Monson and Abol Bridge with no road crossings, no towns, and no easy escape. For northbound thru-hikers, it's the final push before Katahdin. For everyone else, it's Maine's premier wilderness backpacking experience.</p><p>Despite the name, the actual distance is closer to 100 miles (the exact figure varies by trail rerouting). What doesn't vary is the wildness: pristine lakes, rugged mountains, dense forest, and the knowledge that you're truly out there on your own.</p>",

It's not as rugged as the Mahoosuc Range to the south, but the isolation and duration create their own challenges.</p><h3>Highlights</h3><ul><li>Gulf Hagas (\"Maine's Grand Canyon\")</li><li>Chairback Mountain Range</li><li>Whitecap Mountain summit views</li><li>Countless pristine ponds and lakes</li><li>Wildlife: moose, loons, eagles</li></ul>"

You must carry all food from Monson. At typical backpacking weights (1.5-2 lbs/day), that's 10-20 pounds of food—a significant load.</p><p>Some hikers arrange food drops at logging roads (research current access) or go ultralight on calories. Plan carefully.</p><h3>Water</h3><p>Water is abundant—dozens of ponds and streams. Treat all water. This is beaver country; Giardia is a real concern.</p><h3>Gear Requirements</h3><ul><li>Full backpacking kit (tent, sleeping system, stove)</li><li>Bear canister or hanging system (required)</li><li>Water treatment</li><li>Emergency communication (satellite messenger recommended)</li><li>Extra food margin (weather delays happen)</li></ul>"

It's worth a side-trip detour.</p><h3>Gulf Hagas to Whitecap (25 miles)</h3><p>The Chairback Mountain Range provides the trip's most challenging section. Multiple peaks over 2,000 feet with steep ups and downs.</p><h3>Whitecap to Rainbow Lake (30 miles)</h3><p>More moderate terrain through beautiful lake country. Whitecap Mountain offers the best views of the journey.</p><h3>Rainbow Lake to Abol Bridge (25 miles)</h3><p>The home stretch, with Katahdin growing larger on the horizon. Rainbow Lake and Nahmakanta Lake are highlights.</p>"

Lodging and shuttles available in town.</li><li><strong>North (Abol Bridge):</strong> Access to Baxter State Park and Katahdin. Campground and minimal services at the bridge.</li></ul><h3>Direction</h3><p>Most hikers go NOBO (northbound), ending at Katahdin—the logical conclusion. But SOBO works too, starting with Katahdin and saving Monson's pizza for the end.</p><h3>Permits and Fees</h3><p>No permits needed for the 100-Mile Wilderness itself. Baxter State Park (for Katahdin) has separate fees and camping reservations.</p><h3>Shuttles</h3><p>Various services run shuttles to/from trailheads. Arrange in advance, especially for Abol Bridge pickup.</p>"
