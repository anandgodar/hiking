    "introduction": "<p>Mount Marcy is the big one—New York's highest peak at 5,344 feet, centerpiece of the Adirondack High Peaks, and a hike that demands respect. The Mohawk people called it 'Tahawus,' meaning 'cloud-splitter,' and on many days that's exactly what it does, its summit piercing the ceiling of mist that hangs over the surrounding peaks.</p><p>Marcy isn't technically difficult, but it's long and rugged. The standard route is nearly 15 miles round trip with over 3,000 feet of elevation gain—a full day of hiking through wild Adirondack terrain. There are no shortcuts, no gondolas, no crowds of tourists at the top. Just you, the trail, and one of the most remote feeling summits in the Northeast.</p><p>This is the hike that kicks off many 46er quests, the peak that humbles hikers who underestimate it, and the summit that rewards those who come prepared. Here's everything you need to know.</p>",

The well-marked trail climbs steadily through the High Peaks Wilderness, passing Marcy Dam (site of a former dam, now just a scenic crossing), Indian Falls, and finally ascending to the alpine summit.</p><h3>Other Routes</h3><p>Several alternative approaches exist:</p><ul><li><strong>From Elk Lake:</strong> Longer but less crowded</li><li><strong>From Upper Works (via Calamity Brook):</strong> 18+ miles but wilder terrain</li><li><strong>From Johns Brook Lodge:</strong> Popular with overnighters</li></ul><p>For a first Marcy attempt, Van Hoevenberg is the right choice—best maintained, best marked, and most direct.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>Adirondak Loj to Marcy Dam (2.3 miles)</h3><p>The trail starts gently, following an old road before entering the wilderness proper. You'll register at the trailhead (required) and begin a pleasant forest walk to Marcy Dam—a scenic spot where the old dam washed out years ago, leaving a picturesque meadow with mountain views.</p><p>Most hikers pause here, but don't linger too long—you've barely started.</p><h3>Marcy Dam to Indian Falls (2.4 miles)</h3><p>From the dam, the trail begins climbing more seriously. You'll cross several stream crossings and gain elevation steadily through mixed forest. The terrain gets rockier as you ascend.</p><p>Indian Falls is a beautiful cascade worth a brief stop—and a good turnaround point if weather is turning or you're running low on energy.</p><h3>Indian Falls to Summit (2.7 miles)</h3><p>Now the real work begins. Above Indian Falls, the trail steepens significantly, climbing through increasingly stunted forest until breaking above treeline for the final approach.</p><p>The summit cone is rocky and exposed, with cairns marking the route. In fog, navigation requires attention—the alpine zone can be disorienting.</p><h3>The Summit</h3><p>Marcy's summit is a flat, rocky expanse with a benchmark disk marking the high point. Views extend in all directions—Lake Tear of the Clouds (source of the Hudson River) below, surrounding High Peaks forming a wild panorama, Lake Placid glittering in the distance.</p><p>On clear days, you can see Vermont's Green Mountains, the St. Lawrence River lowlands, and what feels like half of New York State.</p>"

The trail is rocky and rooty throughout, with significant wet sections after rain. Trail runners are popular with fast hikers but offer less ankle protection.</p><h3>Bug Protection</h3><p>Black flies (May-June) and mosquitoes can be brutal. Bug spray and/or a head net are recommended, especially in early season.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>Mud</h3><p>The Van Hoevenberg Trail sees heavy use and can be extremely muddy, especially in spring and after rain. Gaiters help; mud up to your ankles is not unusual in wet conditions.</p><h3>Rock Hopping</h3><p>Much of the upper trail involves navigating over roots and rocks. Take your time, especially on the descent when tired legs lead to rolled ankles.</p><h3>Weather</h3><p>Mount Marcy makes its own weather. Clear skies at the trailhead can mean fog, wind, or rain on the summit. Check the forecast but be prepared for anything. If thunderstorms develop, get below treeline immediately.</p><h3>The Alpine Zone</h3><p>Above treeline, stay on the marked trail. The alpine vegetation is fragile and takes decades to recover from damage. Walk on rock surfaces only.</p>"

        "heading": "Making It an Overnight",
        "content": "<h3>Johns Brook Lodge</h3><p>ADK's Johns Brook Lodge sits about 3.5 miles in, offering bunks and meals. Staying here allows you to split the hike over two days, approaching the summit fresh in the morning.</p><h3>Backcountry Camping</h3><p>Camping is permitted at designated sites in the High Peaks Wilderness. Popular options include the Marcy Dam area and sites along the trail. Bear canisters are required for overnight food storage.</p><h3>The Traverse</h3><p>Strong hikers often combine Marcy with nearby peaks—Skylight, Gray, and Haystack are all accessible from the Marcy summit trail. This makes for a very long day or a classic overnight loop.</p>"
