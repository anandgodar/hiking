    "introduction": "<p>Half Dome is the hike. That sheer granite face rising 4,800 feet above Yosemite Valley, the famous cables ascending the final 400 feet of rock—it's an image that draws hikers from around the world. And with good reason: summiting Half Dome is one of the most thrilling hiking experiences in America.</p><p>But there's a catch: you can't just show up and climb. Since 2010, the National Park Service has required permits to ascend the cables, limiting daily visitors to protect both the mountain and the hikers. The permit system can be confusing, frustrating, and competitive—but understanding how it works dramatically improves your chances of standing on that iconic summit.</p><p>Here's everything you need to know about getting a Half Dome permit in 2026.</p>",

        "heading": "The Permit System Explained",
        "content": "<h3>Why Permits Exist</h3><p>Before the permit system, over 1,000 hikers sometimes attempted Half Dome in a single day. The cables became dangerously crowded, with multi-hour waits and rescue situations common. Permits now limit daily climbers to approximately 300, creating a safer, more enjoyable experience.</p><h3>Two Ways to Get a Permit</h3><p>There are two permit opportunities:</p><ol><li><strong>Preseason Lottery:</strong> Apply in March for dates throughout the season</li><li><strong>Daily Lottery:</strong> Apply 2 days before your desired date</li></ol><p>Both lotteries are conducted through Recreation.gov. Let's break down each option.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>Cables Season</h3><p>Permits are required only when the cables are up, typically late May through mid-October. The exact dates depend on snow conditions and are announced each spring.</p><h3>The Cables</h3><p>The final 400 feet of Half Dome involve climbing the famous cables—steel cables strung along the steep granite slope with wooden crossbars for footing. This section is what requires the permit.</p><h3>Off-Season</h3><p>When the cables are down, no permit is required—but climbing the bare rock slope is extremely dangerous and not recommended. The granite is slippery even in good conditions, and falls have been fatal. This is technical climbing territory without the cables.</p>"

You'll climb holding onto steel cables, pulling yourself up the steep granite. Gloves are essential—the cables can be rough on bare hands.</p><h3>Key Considerations</h3><ul><li>Start by 6 AM (or earlier) to allow time for the long day</li><li>Bring 3-4 liters of water minimum</li><li>Pack food, sun protection, and layers</li><li>Bring gloves for the cables (work gloves available at the subdome base)</li><li>Never climb in wet conditions—the rock becomes deadly slippery</li></ul>"

You'll experience the best of the Mist Trail without the cables commitment.</p><h3>Cloud's Rest</h3><p>At 9,926 feet, Cloud's Rest is actually higher than Half Dome and offers arguably better views—including of Half Dome itself. No permit required, and the trail is less crowded.</p><h3>Glacier Point</h3><p>For Half Dome views without the climb, hike to Glacier Point via the Four Mile Trail or Panorama Trail. The vista of Half Dome from Glacier Point is iconic.</p><h3>Try the Daily Lottery</h3><p>If your preseason application failed, keep trying the daily lottery. Many hikers succeed this way—it just requires flexibility.</p>"
