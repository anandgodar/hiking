    "introduction": "<p>There's a place in the Maine woods where the West Branch of the Pleasant River has carved a 3-mile gash through solid slate, creating a gorge that drops 400 feet with waterfalls cascading at every turn. It's called Gulf Hagas, and if you haven't heard of it, you're not alone—this place flies under the radar despite being one of the most spectacular natural features in the Northeast.</p><p>Often called the 'Grand Canyon of Maine' (and yes, the comparison is a bit generous, but the spirit is right), Gulf Hagas delivers a hiking experience unlike anything else in New England: rim walks with views into the abyss, side trails to waterfall viewpoints, challenging terrain that rewards every step, and the remoteness of the 100-Mile Wilderness as a backdrop.</p><p>It's not easy to get to. The hike is long and rugged. And that's exactly why it's so special.</p>",

The Pleasant River has spent millennia cutting through layers of slate and granite, creating a sinuous canyon filled with waterfalls, potholes, and dramatic drops.</p><p>The main waterfalls include:</p><ul><li><strong>Screw Auger Falls:</strong> An iconic double cascade</li><li><strong>Buttermilk Falls:</strong> Wide and churning</li><li><strong>Billings Falls:</strong> Dramatic and steep</li><li><strong>Head of the Gulf:</strong> Where the river plunges into the gorge</li></ul>"

        "heading": "Getting There",
        "content": "<p>Gulf Hagas is remote—that's part of its charm and challenge. There are two main access points:</p><h3>Via Katahdin Iron Works (Most Common)</h3><p>From Brownville Junction, take a gravel road 7 miles to the Katahdin Iron Works gate. Pay the access fee ($15 for non-Maine residents as of 2026), then continue 6 miles on rough logging roads to the parking area.</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> The road is rough. High clearance is recommended, though careful drivers in regular vehicles can make it. After heavy rain, sections may be impassable.</p><h3>Via Greenville</h3><p>From Greenville, take logging roads east. This route is longer but may be in better condition. Check local conditions before committing.</p><h3>The Access Fee</h3><p>The land is privately owned (managed by AMC), so you'll pay an access fee at the gate. Cash recommended. The fee supports trail maintenance and road upkeep.</p>"

        "heading": "Trail Options",
        "content": "<h3>The Classic Rim Loop</h3><p>Most hikers do a loop that follows the rim trail along the top of the gorge, crosses at the head of the gulf, and returns on the Pleasant River Tote Road.</p><p><strong>The route:</strong></p><ol><li>Start at the parking area, hike to Gulf Hagas Brook</li><li>Ford the brook (this can be the crux of the hike—more on that below)</li><li>Follow the Rim Trail along the top of the gorge, taking side trails to waterfall viewpoints</li><li>At the head of the gulf, cross to the Appalachian Trail</li><li>Return via Pleasant River Tote Road</li></ol><p>Total distance: 8-10 miles depending on how many side trails you explore.</p><h3>The River Crossing</h3><p>Early in the hike, you must ford Gulf Hagas Brook. In normal conditions, this is a knee-deep crossing. After rain, it can be thigh-deep or higher. Some key points:</p><ul><li>Bring trekking poles for stability</li><li>Water shoes or sandals make the crossing more comfortable</li><li>In high water, the crossing may be unsafe—check conditions before going</li><li>Early morning typically has lower water than afternoon</li></ul>"

        "heading": "Hiking the Rim Trail",
        "content": "<h3>What to Expect</h3><p>The Rim Trail is not a gentle walk. It's rough, rooty, rocky terrain that climbs and descends repeatedly as it follows the edge of the gorge. You'll scramble over rocks, duck under branches, and navigate sections where the trail clings to steep slopes.</p><p>But every few hundred yards, a side trail beckons to another viewpoint, another waterfall, another moment of standing on the edge of something wild and ancient.</p><h3>Key Viewpoints</h3><ul><li><strong>Screw Auger Falls:</strong> The first major waterfall, easily accessible from a side trail. The double cascade drops into a sculpted pool.</li><li><strong>Hammond Street Pitch:</strong> A dramatic section of rapids where the river squeezes through narrows.</li><li><strong>Buttermilk Falls:</strong> Wide and foamy, with excellent viewing spots from the rim.</li><li><strong>Stair Falls:</strong> A series of stepped cascades.</li><li><strong>Billings Falls:</strong> One of the most dramatic drops in the gulf.</li><li><strong>Head of the Gulf:</strong> Where the river enters the gorge—massive and powerful.</li></ul><h3>Taking Your Time</h3><p>Don't rush Gulf Hagas. The rim trail takes most hikers 4-5 hours even without lingering, and lingering is the whole point. Budget a full day, bring a good lunch, and let the place sink in.</p>"

A blast furnace chimney still stands, offering a glimpse into Maine's industrial past.</p><h3>Little Lyford Lodge</h3><p>AMC operates Little Lyford Lodge in the area, offering backcountry accommodations with meals included. It's a great base for exploring both Gulf Hagas and the surrounding wilderness.</p><h3>100-Mile Wilderness</h3><p>Gulf Hagas sits at the edge of the famous 100-Mile Wilderness—the most remote section of the Appalachian Trail.
