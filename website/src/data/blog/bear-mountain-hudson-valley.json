    "introduction": "<p>Bear Mountain has been a hiking destination since before there was an Appalachian Trail—in fact, the first section of the AT ever built runs across its slopes. Just one hour north of New York City, this 1,284-foot peak offers genuine mountain hiking, Hudson River panoramas, and an escape from urban life that's remarkably accessible.</p><p>The mountain sits in Bear Mountain State Park, with trails ranging from easy paved paths to challenging rocky climbs. The Perkins Memorial Tower at the summit provides 360-degree views that stretch from the NYC skyline to the Catskills on clear days.</p>",
