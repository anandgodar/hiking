    "introduction": "<p>Grafton Notch State Park in western Maine is dominated by Old Speck's hulking presence, but two other destinations deserve equal attention. Table Rock offers one of Maine's most dramatic cliff-top viewpoints for minimal effort, while Baldpate Mountain's twin summits provide serious above-treeline hiking along the Appalachian Trail.</p><p>Whether you want a moderate family hike with spectacular views or a challenging full-day adventure, this area delivers. And unlike more famous destinations, you often have the trails largely to yourself.</p>",

The final approach traverses exposed rock with views that improve with every step.</p><p>The \"table\" itself is a flat granite slab about 30 feet long, suspended above the cliff face. It's a spectacular spot for lunch or photography—just watch your step near the edges.</p><h3>Caves Option</h3><p>A spur trail leads to a series of boulder caves—narrow passages between giant rocks that are fun to explore. They add about 0.4 miles and are worth the detour.</p>"

Both peaks are above treeline, offering expansive views across western Maine and into New Hampshire.</p><h3>The Hike</h3><p>The trail follows the AT northbound from Grafton Notch, climbing relentlessly through forest before emerging into alpine terrain. East Peak comes first, with its open summit and outstanding views. The traverse to West Peak crosses a saddle before the final climb.</p><p>Most hikers do both peaks as an out-and-back, returning the way they came. It's a serious day hike—expect 5-7 hours for the full circuit.</p>"

Long but manageable.</p><h3>Option 2: The Full Loop</h3><p>Table Rock can be linked to the AT via connecting trails, creating a massive loop that includes the overlook, both Baldpate peaks, and a return through the notch. This is 10+ miles and should only be attempted by fit hikers with a full day.</p>"
