    "introduction": "<p>Crawford Notch cuts a dramatic gap through the White Mountains, its steep walls rising 2,000 feet on either side. For nearly two centuries, this pass has been the gateway to the Presidential Range—first by horse, then by rail, now by car and boot.</p><p>The hiking here is remarkably diverse. You can walk to New Hampshire's tallest waterfall in an hour, climb to one of the best viewpoints in the state in under two miles, or tackle multiple 4000-footers in a single ambitious day. History buffs will find some of the oldest trails in America, while families will find gentle paths through spectacular scenery.</p><p>Crawford Notch doesn't get the crowds of Franconia or Pinkham, but the hiking is just as good—maybe better. Here's everything you need to know.</p>",

        "content": "<h3>Mount Willard</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 3.2 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 900 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy-Moderate</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 1.5-2.5 hours</li></ul><p>Mount Willard might be the best bang-for-buck hike in all of New Hampshire. In just 1.6 miles of gentle climbing on an old carriage road, you reach a cliff-edge viewpoint overlooking the entire notch—dramatic walls, the highway ribbon far below, and peaks stretching to the horizon.</p><p>The trail follows the historic Willard carriage road, built in the 1840s to serve the grand hotels. The grade rarely exceeds 10%, making this accessible to almost anyone. Kids, dogs, and hikers of all abilities can handle it.</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Go early or late for the best light and smallest crowds. Sunrise from Willard is spectacular.</p><h3>Arethusa Falls</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.6 miles round trip (via Arethusa Falls Trail)</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 800 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy-Moderate</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 1.5-2 hours</li></ul><p>At 140 feet, Arethusa Falls is the tallest single-drop waterfall in New Hampshire. The hike follows a pleasant woodland path with some rocky sections near the top. The falls are most impressive in spring when snowmelt swells the flow.</p><p>You can combine this with Ripley Falls (via Ripley Falls Trail) for a 4.8-mile loop that bags two major waterfalls.</p><h3>Ripley Falls</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 1.0 mile round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 300 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 30-45 minutes</li></ul><p>A quick out-and-back to a beautiful 100-foot cascade. The trail is short and relatively flat, making this a good option for families with young children or anyone looking for a quick nature fix.</p>"

The summit looks directly at the southern Presidentials, with Mount Washington dominating the horizon. The trail passes several viewpoints on the way up and can be combined with a loop over Mount Field and Mount Tom.</p><h3>Frankenstein Cliff</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 3.8 miles round trip</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,000 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 2-3 hours</li></ul><p>Named for an artist, not the monster, Frankenstein Cliff offers dramatic views of Crawford Notch and the surrounding peaks. In winter, the cliff face becomes a popular ice climbing destination. The hiking trail approaches from the south, with several viewpoints along the way.</p>"

Webster offers exposed cliff walks with stunning views down into the notch; Jackson has a wooded summit with a rock outcrop viewpoint.</p><p>Most hikers go counterclockwise (Webster first), tackling the steep Webster Cliff Trail while legs are fresh and descending the more moderate Jackson Trail. The Webster Cliffs section has some exposure—not technical, but attention-grabbing.</p><h3>Mount Tom, Field, and Avalon Loop</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 8.6 miles</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,800 feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> 5-7 hours</li><li><strong>Peaks:</strong> Mount Tom (4,051'), Mount Field (4,340'), Mount Avalon (3,442')</li></ul><p>A longer day that bags two 4000-footers and crosses the beautiful Zealand Valley. This loop follows the Avalon Trail up, traverses the Willey Range Trail, and descends via the A-Z Trail or back over Avalon. The views from Field's summit are excellent, and the ridgeline walking is pleasant.</p><h3>The Willey Range</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 10+ miles (various options)</li><li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 3,500+ feet</li><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Very Strenuous</li><li><strong>Peaks:</strong> Willey (4,285'), Field (4,340'), Tom (4,051')</li></ul><p>For peak baggers, the full Willey Range traverse hits three 4000-footers in one day. Start from Ethan Pond Trail and work north over the summits. This is a full-day endeavor requiring good fitness and route planning.</p>"

        "content": "<h3>The Crawford Path</h3><p>The Crawford Path, which climbs to Mount Washington from Crawford Depot, is the oldest continuously maintained hiking trail in America—first cut in 1819 by Abel Crawford and his son Ethan Allen Crawford. Walking this trail connects you to nearly 200 years of mountain history.</p><p>The full Crawford Path to Washington is 8.5 miles one way with 5,000+ feet of gain—a serious undertaking. But you can sample it by hiking partway to views, turning back whenever you've had enough.</p><h3>The Grand Hotels</h3><p>In the late 1800s, Crawford Notch hosted grand resort hotels that drew wealthy vacationers from Boston and New York. Fire and time have claimed most of them, but the Crawford Depot building (now an AMC facility) and the cog railway base preserve echoes of that era.</p><h3>The Willey Slide</h3><p>In 1826, a massive landslide swept down Mount Willey, killing the entire Willey family as they fled their home. The house itself was untouched—the slide split around it. This tragedy made national news and helped cement Crawford Notch's reputation as a place of sublime natural power.</p>"
