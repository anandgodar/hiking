      "description": "This northernmost 4,000-footer is a long but relatively gentle hike. The Bunnell Notch Trail leads through mossy forests and past a scenic bog, eventually climbing to Cabot\u2019s summit area. Near the top sits Cabot Cabin (a rustic shelter), and just beyond lies the high point marked by a sign. Though views are limited at the summit itself, a nearby outlook on the spur path provides a nice vista over the forests of the Pilot Range. Cabot\u2019s remote setting gives it a quiet, wild character.",
